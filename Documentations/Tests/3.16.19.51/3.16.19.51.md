## Test 3.16.19.51
- Testing multiple synchronization consecutively
- Run on 5s Model
- number of pallets: 3
- synchronisation frequency was reduced and multiple syncronisation was done.

- Databases attached with the folder
- Terminal output attached in the folder
  
### Observation
- Found an [issue](https://github.com/pedrolbacelar/Digital_Twin/issues/164) with synchronizer. The next synchronizer object does not know exactly what the end point of previous object is.
- This lead to creation of ghost object in the queues.
- Possible solution could be to retain the table in database for the next synchroniser object to refer.
