A key technology behind this opportunity for companies to gain a competitive edge through an informed and intelligent robotized automation is the robotic digital twin (RDT). As such, the RDT will be instrumental in mirroring targeted properties of a physical robot to obtain a digital sibling flexibly harnessed in virtual testbeds to understand, predict, and shape the robot performance. However, these objectives remain challenging to well-established simulators. This is because the architectural and functional capabilities they support are not sufficiently in-line with ever-growing and varying demands for agile and cost-efficient manipulations. As a consequence, robot stakeholders can hardly use RDTs to unlock opportunities and meet needs from prospective markets. This article contributes to addressing this gap. We introduce a novel concept for the development of a RDT that helps create and add value to current and future robotized cyber-physical applications. Hereinafter, referred to as the value-driven RDT (vdRDT), it systematically captures the robot dynamics and purposefully farms data, about which its services reason, to facilitate insight and deliver capabilities as well as benefits to stakeholders. Experiment results show that vdRDTs enlarge the scope of, adapt to, and revitalize robotized applications carried out in different fields. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:46 PM"

One of the most beneficial technologies is the digital twin (DT), which can solve the above issues. This paper investigates aviation industry DT from government authorities, industry, and academia. Firstly, it surveys the development of the definition of DT and compares its concepts with the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, and digital thread etc. Next, it shows the research timeline of aviation DT in the past 10 years by authorities such as Air Force Research Laboratory and National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Then, this paper reviews the state-of-the-art research status of DT in the whole lifecycle of the aviation system and concludes that aviation DT is the most widely used in manufacturing and maintenance, and should pay attention to the application of UAV DT.

This phenomenon is clearly observable in the manufacturing sector, where, due to the diffusion of Industry 4.0 paradigm, physical processes are integrating effectively with digital ones. One recent innovative technology is the Digital Twin (DT), where digital models and physical ones communicate – by sharing data as well as information – usually in a bidirectional way. As recent studies have analyzed the current level of adoption of DT technologies in the manufacturing sector, less effort has been focused on evaluating applications in the safety domain. Theoretically, the DT inherent capability of acquiring data from the physical world - usually developed in real time – together with the potentiality of reliable data processing could support a more effective diffusion of dynamic risk assessment models as well as real time alert management systems for improving safety. Otherwise, the actual capability of real applications highly depends on the level of complexity of the specific DT. The aim of the study is to provide a methodology to assess current application of DT technologies, the framework has been developed in the safety domain aiming to point out to researchers as well as technicians in a clear way the capabilities of a specific DT application. The framework has been adopted for analyzing current applications of DT in the scientific literature aiming to propose a theoretical validation. The application has outlined that, although the number of DT applications in the safety field is not so large, the current tools developed are characterized by a high level of complexity thus providing higher reliability to support the specific safety problem in analysis.

The idea is to bring every data source and control interface description related to a product or process available through a single interface, for auto-discovery and automated communication establishment. However, designing the architecture of a DT to serve every future application is an ambitious task. Therefore, the prototyping systems for specific applications are required to design the DT incrementally. We developed a novel DT prototype to analyze the requirements of communication in a mission-critical application such as mobile networks supported remote surgery. Such operations require low latency and high levels of security and reliability and therefore are a perfect subject for analyzing DT communication and cybersecurity. The system comprised of a robotic arm and HTC vive virtual reality (VR) system connected over a 4G mobile network. More than 70 test users were employed to assess the system. To address the cybersecurity of the system, we incorporated a network manipulation module to test the effect of network outages and attacks, we studied state of the art practices and their utilization within DTs. The capability of the system for actual remote surgery is limited by capabilities of the VR system and insufficient feedback from the robot. However, simulations and research of remote surgeries could be conducted with the system. As a result, we propose ideas for communication establishment and necessary cybersecurity technologies that will help in developing the DT architecture. Furthermore, we concluded that developing the DT requires cross-disciplinary development in several different engineering fields. Each field makes use of its own tools and methods, which do not always fit together perfectly.

Therefore, digital twin, a new technology which can be integrated and fused with most New IT (including cloud computing, Internet of things, big data, artificial intelligence, 5G, etc.), was employed and introduced into satellite industry (including key stages, key scenarios and key entities), and a novel concept of Digital Twin Satellite (DTS) was proposed and studied. The composition of DTS was analyzed from the spatial dimension, including DTS experimental verification system, DTS assembly shop-floor, DTS product, and DTS network. Then the core elements of DTS were illustrated from the time dimension, including model thread, data thread, and service thread. The key technologies of DTS were put forward. The applications of DTS in different stages were discussed from the life cycle dimension, including satellite overall design, detailed design, production and manufacturing (including general assembly, integration and testing), on-orbit service and health management, network operation and maintenance management. It is expected this study can provide references for satellite industry development and satellite engineering construction in the future. © 2020, Editorial Department of CIMS.

Most of the literature argues that simulation models are a key platform for digital twins and considers discrete-event simulation to be a suitable method to model real dynamic manufacturing systems. However, the discrete-event simulation of complex manufacturing systems is a time-consuming process. Therefore, it is difficult to deal with the large-scale discrete optimisation problems in digital twin shop floors. To bridge this research gap, we propose an improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation method based on multi-fidelity optimisation with ordinal transformation and optimal sampling (MO2TOS) in the current research. The proposed method embeds heuristic algorithms to accelerate the solution space search efficiency in MO2TOS. Moreover, we develop an improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation system by integrating the proposed method with discrete-event simulation tools and apply this system to a digital twin-based aircraft parts production workshop. Based on this digital twin shop floor, we conduct different production planning experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation method is well-applied in solving large-scale problems and outperforms other simulation-based optimisation methods. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:46 PM"

An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches.

This has realized the need for artificial intelligence tools for robust data processing. However, the large size of input data requires real time monitoring and synchronization for online analysis. As the star concept behind the Industry 4.0 wave, a digital twin is a virtual, multi-scale and probabilistic simulation to mirror the performance of its physical counterpart and serve the product lifecycle in a virtual space. Evidently, a digital twin can proactively identify potential issues with its corresponding real twin. Thus, it is best suited for enabling a physics-based and data-driven model fusion to estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of the components. Traditional RUL prediction approaches have assumed either an exponential or linear degradation trend with a fixed curve shape to build a Health Index (HI) model. Such an assumption may not be useful for multi-sensor systems or cases where sensor data is available intermittently. A common constraint in the industry is irregular sensor data collection. The resulting asynchronous time series of the sporadic data needs to be an accurate representation of the component's HI when constructing a degradation model. In this paper, we extend the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique to generate RUL prediction within a digital twin framework as a means of synchronization with changing operational states. More specifically, we first use LSTM encoder-decoder (LSTM-ED) to train a multilayered neural network and reconstruct the sensor data time series corresponding to a healthy state. The resulting reconstruction error can be used to capture patterns in input data time series and estimate HI of training and testing sets. Using a time lag to record similarity between the HI curves, a weighted average of the final RUL estimation is obtained. The described empirical approach is evaluated on publicly available engine degradation dataset with run-to-failure information. Results indicate a high RUL estimation accuracy with greater error reduction rate. This demonstrates wide applicability of the discussed methodology to various industries where event data is scarce for the application of only data-driven techniques. © 2020 IEEE.",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:46 PM"

Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications based on Machine Learning (ML) are widely accepted as promising technologies in manufacturing. However, ML methods require large volumes of quality training datasets and in the case of supervised ML, manual input is usually required for labelling those datasets. Such an approach is expensive, prone to errors and labour as well as time-intensive, especially in a highly complex and dynamic production environment. DT models can be utilized for accelerating the training phase in ML by creating suitable training datasets as well as by automatic labelling via the simulation tools chain and thus alleviating user’s involvement during training. These synthetic datasets can be enhanced and cross-validated with real-world information which is not required to be extensive. A framework for implementing the proposed DT-driven approach for developing ML models is presented. The proposed framework has been implemented in an industrially relevant use case. The use case has provided evidence that the proposed concept can be used for training vision-based recognition of parts’ orientation using simulation of DT models, which in turn can be used for adaptively controlling the production process. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:46 PM"

Commonly, different sensors are integrated into work environments to track workers' actions. Game elements are selected according to the work task and users' preferences. However, implementing gamified workplaces remains challenging as different data sources must be established, evaluated, and connected. Developers often require information from several areas of the companies to offer meaningful gamification strategies for their employees. Moreover, work environments and the associated support systems are usually not flexible enough to adapt to personal needs. Digital twins are one primary possibility to create a uniform data approach that can provide semantic information to gamification applications. Frequently, several digital twins have to interact with each other to provide information about the workplace, the manufacturing process, and the knowledge of the employees.

Due to the lack of an operational application architecture model, it is impossible to map the complex system comprehensively. Based on the review of the concept model of DT and the current research situation in the smart grid (SG), an OKDD [i.e., ontology-body (OB), knowledge-body (KB), data-body (DB), and digital-portal (DP)] model of digital twin body (DTB) is proposed and specified in detail. Taking a vacuum circuit breaker and a 35 kV substation of the power grid as examples, the OKDD is applied in the DTB construction, and the developed prognostic and health management (PHM) system demo is practiced in a 110 kV substation simply. The approach is proved to be feasible preliminarily. This model provides a novel method for the unified description and standardization of DTB, which is conducive to the hierarchical creation (unit-system-system of systems) for complex systems. Meanwhile, it can represent complex physical entities more comprehensively, and enable the reuse of knowledge and the duplication of similar unit-level DTB rapidly. Thus, this research provides a new reference for the practical application of DT. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:46 PM"

A digital twin of a vehicle includes a model of the braking system, which is essential for ensuring safety. Modern automated braking systems are difficult to reproduce in a simulation, because of the sheer number of factors involved. Furthermore, there are additional processes that also have a substantial impact on both the system's performance and the vehicle position in physical space. This paper covers the principles of applying a virtual and physical simulation technology to the production of a digital twin of active vehicle safety systems. We begin our study by analyzing the Vehicle-Driver-Road system and ranking its elements. Within the Vehicle system, in turn, we also build a hierarchy of the subsystems relevant to the simulation, ranking them by priority level. In the course of system analysis, we arrange all modules by priority, considering the traffic conditions. In the case of this particular study, we are dealing with the braking mode, and therefore give priority to the braking system module over the other subsystems and modules. We also suggest various ways of structuring the model of the braking system itself, depending on the task. The tasks are grouped by difficulty, in ascending order, from the task of designing an algorithm for controlling a single wheel to the task of controlling an entire automated braking system of a multiwheel vehicle, across all possible automation levels (i.e. both the self-driving mode and the operation mode involving a real driver with unique physical and psychological characteristics). The virtual and physical simulation technology, as exemplified by the braking system, enables the improvement and adjustment of digital twins of both current and future vehicles. © 2020 The Authors.

As a result, massive data of different types are being produced. However, these data are hysteretic and isolated from each other, leading to low efficiency and low utilization of these valuable data. Simulation based on theoretical and static model has been a conventional and powerful tool for the verification, validation, and optimization of a system in its early planning stage, but no attention is paid to the simulation application during system run-time. With the development of new-generation information and digitalization technologies, more data can be collected, and it is time to find a way for the deep application of all these data. As a result, the concept of digital twin has aroused much concern and is developing rapidly. Dispute and discussions around concepts, paradigms, frameworks, applications, and technologies of digital twin are on the rise both in academic and industrial communities. After a complete search of several databases and careful selection according to the proposed criteria, 240 academic publications about digital twin are identified and classified. This paper conducts a comprehensive and in-depth review of these literatures to analyze digital twin from the perspective of concepts, technologies, and industrial applications. Research status, evolution of the concept, key enabling technologies of three aspects, and fifteen kinds of industrial applications in respective lifecycle phase are demonstrated in detail.

Currently, DT is applied to all stages of the product lifecycle, including design, production, and service, although its application in the production stage is not yet extensive. Shop-floor digital twin (SDT) is a digital mapping model of the corresponding physical shop-floor. How to build and apply SDT has always been challenging when applying DT technology in the production phase. To address the existing problems, this paper first reviews the origin and evolution of DT, including its application status in the production stage. Then, an implementation framework for the construction and application of SDT is proposed. Three key implementation techniques are explained in detail: the five-dimensional modeling of SDT, DT-based 3D visual and real-time monitoring of shop-floor operating status, and prediction of shop-floor operating status based on SDT using Markov chain. A DT-based visual monitoring and prediction system (DT-VMPS) for shop-floor operating status is developed, and the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated through the use of an engineering case study.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an efficient technique for establishing robust dispatching rules, however, only a few cases that coordinate RL-based production control with a digital twin (DT) have been reported. This study proposes a novel production control model that applies a DT and horizontal coordination with RL-based production control.

A suitable architectural framework, service composition, and systematic logic library schema were developed to exploit the advanced characteristics of the DT and improve the existing production control methods. This study is an early case of coordinating RL and DT, and the findings revealed that RL policy networks should be imported in the creation procedures rather than being synchronised to the DT.

As for a complex discrete manufacturing system (DMS), it is a digital model for emulating or reproducing the functions or actions of a real manufacturing system by giving the system simulation information or directly driven by a real system with proper connections between the DT model and the real-world system. It is a key building block for smart factory and manufacturing under the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The key research question is how to effectively create a DT model during the design stage of a complex manufacturing system and to make it usable throughout the system's lifecycle such as the production stage. Given that there are some existing discussions on DT framework development, this paper focuses on the modeling methods for rapidly creating a virtual model and the connection implementation mechanism between a physical world production system at a workshop level and its mirrored virtual model. To reach above goals, in this paper, the discrete event system (DES) modeling theory is applied to the three-dimension DT model. First, for formally representing a manufacturing system and creating its virtual model, seven basic elements: controller, executor, processor, buffer, flowing entity, virtual service node and logistics path of a DMS have been identified and the concept of the logistics path network and the service cell is introduced to uniformly describe a manufacturing system. Second, for implementing interconnection and interaction, a new interconnection and data interaction mechanism between the physical system and its virtual model for through-life applications has been designed. With them, each service cell consists of seven elements and encapsulates input/output information and control logic. All the discrete cells are constructed and mapped onto different production-process-oriented digital manufacturing modules by integrating logical, geometric and data models. As a result, the virtual-physical connection is realized to form a DT model. The proposed virtual modeling method and the associated connection mechanism have been applied to a real-world workshop DT to demonstrate its practicality and usefulness. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:46 PM"

Two of these are virtual reality (VR), which has grown immensely in the gaming sector, and 3-D imaging, which is commonly used in archeology and construction. This study presents lessons learned from combining these two technologies in an industrial context with the digital twin concept. Three industrial case studies have been performed, and several observations have been identified in all three aspects of sustainability. For example, improved solution fidelity at an early stage can be achieved by externalizing tacit knowledge, and multiple issues during planning and installation phases have been avoided by utilizing the hybrid digital twin models. This type of digital twin enables highly detailed production system access, enabling engineering abilities from anywhere, anytime. Furthermore, the model becomes a powerful communication tool, which has reduced the resistance to workplace changes, as stakeholders lacking computer-aided design (CAD) knowledge can be involved in the change process. The highly detailed models have also allowed more focus to be put on safety and regulations, as these aspects naturally are more suited to experience in immersive VR.

However, for simplicity, the processing facilities are usually only considered as fixed oil, gas and water flow rate constraints. Actual production limits vary as a function of operating conditions and/or cannot be measured directly (e.g. True Vapour Pressure (TVP) or gas velocity at the inlet separator nozzles). To improve on existing workflows, BP has expanded its existing petroleum engineering-focused toolkit and is now globally deploying an end-to-end production system digital twin that extends from the well choke to the facility export for system surveillance and optimization. The end-to-end production system digital twin is a cloud-based system that links sensor data from the asset historian with an equipment data model and third-party first principle steady state simulation tools for an accurate representation of the well network and processing facilities. It supports multi-discipline collaboration, particularly between Petroleum Engineers and Process Engineers, and is remotely accessible by a globally dispersed team. This integrated digital twin can be used in two modes: monitoring and what-if. In monitoring mode, the models are automatically updated hourly with real time data and key simulation results extracted and stored. These monitoring simulations generate virtual sensor output, providing insights that cannot be measured by real sensors. In what-if mode, engineers test scenarios risk-free to explore optimization opportunities. As well as routine optimizations to align with production forecast updates, this can also include scenarios during planned abnormal operations (e.g. facility equipment offline for maintenance or well flowback). An early pilot in a key production region delivered significant production upside and was foundational for the subsequent global roll-out program.

Although these new approaches aim to deliver more flexibility and adaptability to the shop floor, they are not being readily adopted and utilised by the manufacturers. One of the main challenges is the unpredictability of the proposed solutions and the uncertainty associated with these approaches. Hence, the proposed research aims to explore the utilisation of Digital Twins (DTs) to predict and understand the execution of these systems in runtime. The Fourth Industrial Revolution is leading to the emergence of new concepts amongst which DT stand out. Given their early stage, however, the already existing implementations are far from standardised, meaning that each practical case has to be analysed on its own and solutions are often created from scratch. Taking the aforementioned into account, the authors suggest an architecture that enables the integration between a previously designed and developed agent-based distributed control system and its DT, whose implementation is also provided in detail. Furthermore, the digital model’s calibration is described jointly with the careful validation process carried out. Thanks to the latter, several conclusions and guidelines for future implementations were possible to derive as well. © 2021 by the authors.

There was also a rapid increase in the level of production automation with a simultaneously growing level of flexibility in manufacturing systems, forced by the need to adapt the product to the customer's needs (mass customization). These factors influenced the formation of a new concept for the development of industrial systems, referred to as Industry 4.0. It refers to production based on cyber-physical systems, integrating manufacturing, logistics, and distribution. One of the main components of an intelligent factory, based on cyber-physical systems, is the virtual equivalent of a real system in the form of the digital twin. Based on the feedback from the real system, a digital simulation supported by analytical software on the information platform is created. Dynamic simulation models should automatically adapt to changes in physical objects of the analysed system. Therefore, models of real objects reflecting their current state and logic of behaviour are required. The methods of automatic or semi-automatic generation of simulation models are the answer to these problems. They are based on approaches using data and information obtained from ERP/MES/CAD systems.

Simulation-based DTs (SBDTs) are those based on online first-principles simulation models. In these systems, model parameter estimation techniques keep an online plant simulator in the same state as the targeted device or process. As a result, non-measured information of the current state of the plant can be obtained from the model. SBDTs can be used for a number of important applications and they have various advantages compared to DTs based on data-driven models. However, wider industrial adoption of SBDTs is hindered by laborious development of their underlying first-principles simulation model as well as by a lack of integrated lifecycle-wide implementation methods and simulation architectures. This paper focuses on applying previously presented methods for reducing implementation effort of SBDTs. Firstly, laborious simulation model development is tackled by applying an automatic model generation method. Secondly, an integrated implementation methodology of a lifecycle-wide online simulation architecture is followed for developing the SBDT. A SBDT of a laboratory-scale process is implemented to demonstrate the proposed method.

However, the development of digital twins is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. This article proposes a semi-automated methodology to generate digital twins for process plants by extracting process data from engineering documents using text and image processing techniques. The extracted information is used to build an intermediate graph model, which serves as a starting point for generating a model in a simulation software. The translation of a graph-based model into a simulation software environment necessitates the use of simulator-specific mapping rules. This paper describes an approach for generating a digital twin based on a steady state simulation model, using a Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) as the main source of information. The steady state modeling paradigm is especially suitable for use cases involving retrofits for an operational process plant, also known as a brownfield plant. A methodology and toolchain is proposed, consisting of manual, semi-automated and fully automated steps. A pilot scale brownfield fiber processing plant was used as a case study to demonstrate our proposed methodology and toolchain, and to identify and address issues that may not occur in laboratory scale case studies.

In the internal concept planning phase, planners do cost calculations and layouts for ordering factory suppliers. However, for integration planning, the original concept and rough planning project have to be updated. Therefore, a new concept has been developed which uses current information from the cyber-physical system and a current 3D scan to update the bill of resources and the layout planning on demand. © 2018 IEEE.",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:52 PM"

The degree of automation in this area is low. Caused by the great variability of construction projects and building components, automation systems that can adapt flexibly to different construction projects are required. However, a system that fulfills these conditions does not yet exist. Down-times for reconfiguration in between projects must be short. The use of robotics for the automation of prefabrication is constantly developing. Recent publications present a novel, flexible, reconfigurable, and transportable manufacturing platform using industrial robots. A system consisting of several of these modular platforms can be flexibly adapted to the changing requirements of different construction projects and set up on-site at local timber construction companies. To ensure the manufacturability of the timber components and to minimize downtimes between projects, the entire workflow from digital design to fabrication must be considered. The co-design approach makes this possible. It breaks up the currently existing sequential process from design to fabrication and considers all sub-steps holistically. Thus, enabling the consideration of the fabrication capabilities during building design. This allows the planning of building components and system layout so that fabrication is feasible. To achieve this, the fabricability of a given system layout has to be evaluated. This requires a digital twin of the fabrication system as a simulation model. The reconfigurability of the fabrication system must be reflected by the digital twin. The fabrication tasks and the system configuration are constantly changed in search of a valid combination. Therefore, with each iteration, the digital twin must be adapted or newly created. At present, this is mostly a manual process. This makes the whole approach unfeasible. To solve this problem, this work presents an approach for the automated, model-based generation of digital twins for the simulation of reconfigurable fabrication systems for timber prefabrication. © 2021 Proceedings of the International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction.

Prior studies have provided insights into the benefits of digital twins that combined both data and simulation approaches, however, there remains a managerial gap. The purpose of this paper is to explore this research gap using input from a multiple case study research design from both manufacturing environments and non-manufacturing environments. The authors use ten cases to explore how digital twins support value co-creation through decision-making. The authors were all involved in the development of the ten cases. Individual biases were removed by using the literature to provide the assessment dimensions and allowing a convergence of the results. Drawing on the lessons from the ten cases, this study empirically identified eight managerial issues that need to be considered when developing digital twins to support multi-stakeholder decision-making that leads to value co-creation. The application of digital twins in value co-creation and decision-making is a topic that has developed from practice and is an area where a research gap exists between theory and practice. A cross-case analysis was developed based on the literature and the ten cases (eight industrial and two pilot-scale cases) providing the empirical findings.

Tools that guide the development of manufacturing to have less environmental impact are being deployed and documented. The power of digital technology to enable manufacturing systems to be more productive is well established and advances continue to be made. What is less well known is how digital technology can support the pursuit of sustainable manufacturing, especially using digital models, shadows and twins. Here a digital simulation model is configured to analyse, replicate and drive the real production respectively to improve resource productivity in the widest sense. This paper considers the literature and practice of such digital tools in manufacturing operations as well as across the lifecycle. Literature considered is mostly from 2018 onwards as this is the point at which digital twin empirical work emerges. Whilst the work on digital twins is advancing fast, the work on sustainable manufacturing is limited to energy and, to some extent, resource efficiency. Further when compared to documented practice, the academic field appears to be lagging depending on how the loose definition of digital twins in practice is interpreted.

Hardware-in-the-loop setups are routinely used by manufacturing companies to carry out virtual commissioning. However, manufacturing companies having online legacy production systems are still struggling to incorporate a digital twin due to the absence of verified and validated simulation models. Companies that use virtual commissioning as a part of their engineering tool chain, usually perform offline verification of the simulation model. This approach is typically based on visual inspection and is a tedious task as each aspect of the model has to be visually validated. For legacy systems, only assessing the behavior visually in the absence of updated documents can result in an incorrect simulation model, i.e. simulating incorrect behavior with respect to the specification. Due to this, such simulation models cannot be incorporated in the engineering tool chain, as the simulated results can lead to improper decisions and can even cause equipment damage.

Making explicit the uncertainty of the data transferred from the physical domain is relevant to achieve the objectives of reducing uncertainty and improving predictions. The realisation of the digital twin requires implementing an interoperable data driven architecture between the physical and the digital domains.

MMS enables restructuring of its configuration to accommodate product changes and is thus an efficient solution to reduce the costs involved in personalized production. A micro smart factory (MSF) is an MMS with heterogeneous production processes to enable personalized production. Similar to MMS, MSF also enables the restructuring of production configuration, additionally, it comprises cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) that help achieve resilience. However, MSFs need to overcome performance hurdles with respect to production control. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twin (DT) and reinforcement learning (RL)-based production control method. This method replaces the existing dispatching rule in the type and instance phases of the MSF. In this method, the RL policy network is learned and evaluated by coordination between DT and RL. The DT provides virtual event logs that include states, actions, and rewards to support learning. These virtual event logs are returned based on vertical integration with the MSF. As a result, the proposed method provides a resilient solution to the CPPS architectural framework and achieves appropriate actions to the dynamic situation of MSF. Additionally, applying DT with RL helps decide what-next/where-next in the production cycle. Moreover, the proposed concept can be extended to various manufacturing domains because the priority rule concept is frequently applied. © 2021 by the authors.",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:56 PM"

Before a production schedule is generated to process the incoming production orders, production planning is performed. Given the large number of input parameters involved in the production planning, it poses the challenge on how to systematically and accurately predict and evaluate production performance. Hence, it is important to understand the interactions of the input parameters between the production planning and the scheduling. This is to ensure that the production planning and the scheduling are coordinated and can be performed to achieve optimal production performance such as minimizing cost effectively and efficiently. Digital twin presents an opportunity to mirror the real-time production status and analyze the input parameters affecting the production performance in smart manufacturing. In this paper, we propose an approach to develop a surrogate model to predict the production performance using input parameters from a production plan using the capabilities of real-time synchronization of production data in digital twin. Multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) is applied to construct a surrogate model based on three categories of input parameters, i.e., current production system load, machine-based and product-based parameters. An industrial case study involving a wafer fabrication production is used to develop the surrogate model based on a random sampling of varying numbers of training data set. The proposed MARS model shows a high correlation coefficient and a large reduction in the number of input parameters for both linear and nonlinear cases with relation to three performances, namely flowtime, tardiness, and machine utilization.

Our digital twins used process experts' knowledge to capture physical behavior such as thermal response, cure kinetics, and rheometrics. Specialized algorithms then extracted Features for Quality (FFQ) from this physical behavior. Quality models finally predicted the probability of making a good part. After construction, the PDT was embedded into the manufacturing process. In our case, a production associate plans a cure process by using a web based interface and inputs including material properties, part types, outtime, tooling features and autoclave characteristics. If the yield target is not met, then an optimizer suggests changes in the controllable inputs such as autoclave location or cure recipe. This optimization ensures stable, high yield production.

Under such circumstances, production systems are influenced by more frequent uncertainties, and the planning-based production decision and control approach is no longer applicable. The opti-state control (OsC) method is proposed to help SPOS keep in an optimal state when uncertainties affect the system. Besides, a digital twin-based control framework (DTCF) is designed for getting the full element information needed for decision making. Based on the comprehensive information of the production system obtained by the DTCF, the OsC method is introduced to the virtual control layer to formulate the optimal target guiding the path of the system in real time through the dynamic matching mechanism (qualitative perspective). Then multi-stage synchronized control with analysis target cascading (ATC) method is used to get the local optimal state decisions (quantitative perspective).

The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT's structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors. © 2021",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:56 PM"

Therefore, in this research, I examine a digital twin model that enables work improvement support by creating analog-type elements, such as visualizing known integrals, and by reconciling a real factory with its virtual one instead of aiming for higher productivity using excessive digitization and automation, such as that in Industry 4.0. I have developed an architecture that makes it possible to find solutions or answers by projecting effective internet of things (IoT) and digital manufacturing (DM) uses at production sites and how to evaluate manufacturing processes on a digital twin model, using production activity based on the plan-do-check-action (PDCA) cycle widely used in the Japanese manufacturing industry.

However, the data transmission bandwidth and sensor placement limitations in the physical systems may not allow us to collect the amount or the type of data that we wish. Recently, a physics-based compressive sensing (PBCS) approach was proposed to monitor manufacturing processes and obtain high-fidelity information with the reduced number of sensors by incorporating physical models of processes in compressed sensing. It can recover and reconstruct complete three-dimensional temperature distributions based on some limited measurements. In this paper, a constrained orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm is developed for PBCS, where coherence exists between the measurement matrix and the basis matrix. The efficiency of recovery is improved by introducing a boundary-domain reduction approach, which reduces the size of PBCS model matrices during the inverse operations. The improved PBCS method is demonstrated with the measurement of temperature distributions in the cooling and real-time printing processes of fused filament fabrication. © 2021 by ASME",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:56 PM"

Consequently, the costly physical commissioning of a new manufacturing system is greatly hindered. As an emerging technology, digital twins can achieve semi-physical simulation to avoid the vast cost of physical commissioning of the manufacturing system. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning (DT-RSPC) approach for open architecture flow-type smart manufacturing systems. A digital twin system is developed to enable the remote semi-physical commissioning. The proposed approach is validated through a case study of digital twins-based remote semi-physical commissioning of a smartphone assembly line.

The article shows that, despite the long history and success in the development of production information systems, the concept of building digital twins of production systems is at an early stage. One of the problems in creating digital twins is the need for integration and joint processing of a large amount of heterogeneous information. It is shown that the problem of reflecting the current state of the production system is in many ways similar to the problem of the internal representation of the surrounding world in living systems. It is proposed to choose the theory of the levels of the physiologist N. A. Bernstein as the basis of the conceptual approach to the development of digital twins. The mechanisms of forming models of the external world at every level are outlined. A description of the hierarchical system for processing different types of information and obtaining an invariant representation of the external world are presented.

Industrial Digital Twins software toolkits usually consist of simulation or offline programming tools. It can even connect real machines and controllers and sensors to feed a simulation with actual production data and later analyze it. Moreover, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are used in different ways for monitoring and design purposes. However, there are many software tools for the simulation and re-programming of robots on the market already, but those are a limited number of software that combine all these features, and all of those send data only in one way, not allowing to re-program machines from the simulations. The related research aims to build a modular framework for designing and deploying Digital Twins of industrial equipment (i.e., robots, manufacturing lines), focusing on online connectivity for monitoring and control. A developed use-case solution enables one to operate the equipment in VR/AR/Personal Computer (PC) and mobile interfaces from any point globally while receiving real-time feedback and state information of the machinery equipment. Gamified multiplatform interfaces allow for more intuitive interactions with Digital Twins, providing a real-scale model of the real device, augmented by spatial UIs, actuated physical elements, and gesture tracking. The introduced solution can control and simulate any aspect of the production line without limitation of brand or type of the machine and being managed and self-learning independently by exploiting Machine Learning algorithms. Moreover, various interfaces such as PC, mobile, VR, and AR give an unlimited number of options for interactions with your manufacturing shop floor both offline and online. Furthermore, when it comes to manufacturing floor data monitoring, all gathered data is being used for statistical analysis, and in a later phase, predictive maintenance functions are enabled based on it.

As the post-process quality assurance of large parts is costly and time-consuming, process monitoring is inevitable. In the present study, a context-aware monitoring solution was investigated by integrating machine, temporal, and spatial context in the data analysis. By analyzing the voltage patterns of each cycle in the oscillating cold metal transfer process with a deep neural network, temporal context was included. Spatial context awareness was enabled by building a digital twin of the manufactured part using an Octree as spatial indexing data structure. By means of the spatial context awareness, two quality metrics—the defect expansion and the local anomaly density—were introduced. The defect expansion was tracked in-process by assigning detected defects to the same defect cluster in case of spatial correlation. The local anomaly density was derived by defining a spherical region of interest which enabled the detection of aggregations of anomalies. By means of the context aware monitoring system, defects were detected in-process with a higher sensitivity as common defect detectors for welding applications, showing less false-positives and false-negatives.

The application of such advanced capabilities particularly to highly digitalized processes such as metal additive manufacturing (AM) is likely to make those processes commercially more attractive. AI capabilities will reside within Digital Twins (DTs) which are living virtual replicas of the physical processes. DTs will be empowered to operate autonomously in a diagnostic control capacity to supervise processes and can be interrogated by the practitioner to inform the optimal processing route for any given product. The utility of the information gained from the DTs would depend on the quality of the digital models and, more importantly, their faster-solving surrogates which dwell within DTs for consultation during rapid decision-making. In this article, we point out the exceptional value of DTs in AM and focus on the need to create high-fidelity multiscale-multiphysics models for AM processes to feed the AI capabilities. We identify technical hurdles for their development, including those arising from the multiscale and multiphysics characteristics of the models, the difficulties in linking models of the subprocesses across scales and physics, and the scarcity of experimental data. We discuss the need for creating surrogate models using machine learning approaches for real-time problem-solving. We further identify non-technical barriers, such as the need for standardization and difficulties in collaborating across different types of institutions. We offer potential solutions for all these challenges, after reflecting on and researching discussions held at an international symposium on the subject in 2019. We argue that a collaborative approach can not only help accelerate their development compared with disparate efforts, but also enhance the quality of the models by allowing modular development and linkages that account for interactions between the various sub-processes in AM.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an efficient technique for establishing robust dispatching rules, however, only a few cases that coordinate RL-based production control with a digital twin (DT) have been reported. This study proposes a novel production control model that applies a DT and horizontal coordination with RL-based production control. The requirements for dispatching in the RJS and coordination between RL and the DT were defined. A suitable architectural framework, service composition, and systematic logic library schema were developed to exploit the advanced characteristics of the DT and improve the existing production control methods. This study is an early case of coordinating RL and DT, and the findings revealed that RL policy networks should be imported in the creation procedures rather than being synchronised to the DT. The results should be a valuable reference for research on other types of RL-based production control with regard to horizontal coordination. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:56 PM"

As for a complex discrete manufacturing system (DMS), it is a digital model for emulating or reproducing the functions or actions of a real manufacturing system by giving the system simulation information or directly driven by a real system with proper connections between the DT model and the real-world system. It is a key building block for smart factory and manufacturing under the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The key research question is how to effectively create a DT model during the design stage of a complex manufacturing system and to make it usable throughout the system's lifecycle such as the production stage. Given that there are some existing discussions on DT framework development, this paper focuses on the modeling methods for rapidly creating a virtual model and the connection implementation mechanism between a physical world production system at a workshop level and its mirrored virtual model. To reach above goals, in this paper, the discrete event system (DES) modeling theory is applied to the three-dimension DT model. First, for formally representing a manufacturing system and creating its virtual model, seven basic elements: controller, executor, processor, buffer, flowing entity, virtual service node and logistics path of a DMS have been identified and the concept of the logistics path network and the service cell is introduced to uniformly describe a manufacturing system. Second, for implementing interconnection and interaction, a new interconnection and data interaction mechanism between the physical system and its virtual model for through-life applications has been designed. With them, each service cell consists of seven elements and encapsulates input/output information and control logic. All the discrete cells are constructed and mapped onto different production-process-oriented digital manufacturing modules by integrating logical, geometric and data models. As a result, the virtual-physical connection is realized to form a DT model.

Additionally, expansion in connectivity, growth in data storage, and the implementation of the industrial internet of things (IIoT) allow for greater opportunities not only with digital twins but with closed loop analytics. Discrete event simulation (DES) has been used to create digital twins and, in some instances, fitted with live connections to closely monitor factory operations. However, the benefits of a connected digital twin are not easily quantified. Therefore, a test bed demonstration factory was used, which implements smart technologies, to evaluate the effectiveness of a closed-loop digital twin in identifying and reacting to trends in production. This involves a digital twin of a factory process using DES. Although traditional DES is typically modeled using historical data, a DES system was developed which made use of live data to improve predictions. This model had live data updated directly to the DES model without user interaction, creating an adaptive and dynamic model. It was found that this DES with live data typically provided more accurate predictions of future performance and unforeseen near future problems when compared to the predictions of a traditional DES using only historic data, resulting in smarter decisions and implementation of more timely solutions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 6:59 PM"

Digital twins that communicate with their physical counterparts throughout their lifecycle are the basis for data-driven factories. The problem with developing digital models that form the digital twin is that they operate with large amounts of heterogeneous data. Since the models represent simplifications of the physical world, managing the heterogeneous data and linking the data with the digital twin represent a challenge. The paper proposes a five-step approach to planning data-driven digital twins of manufacturing systems and their processes. The approach guides the user from breaking down the system and the underlying building blocks of the processes into four groups. The development of a digital model includes predefined necessary parameters that allow a digital model connecting with a real manufacturing system. The connection enables the control of the real manufacturing system and allows the creation of the digital twin.

Conventional oil and gas reserves are finite and are being depleted at a relatively rapid pace. With alternative fuels and technologies still unable to fill the gap, research and development of unconventional petroleum resources have accelerated markedly in the past 20 years. With some of the largest bitumen deposits in the world, Canada has an active oil mining and refining industry. Bitumen deposits, also called oil sands, are formed in complex geological environments and subject to a host of syn-and post-depositional processes. As a result, some ores are heterogeneous, at both individual reservoir and regional scales, which poses significant problems in terms of extractive processing. Moreover, with increased environmental awareness and enhanced governmental regulations and industry best practices, it is critical for oil sands producers to improve process efficiencies across the spectrum. Discrete event simulation (DES) is a computational paradigm to develop dynamic digital twins, including the interactions of critical variables and processes. In the case of mining systems, the digital twin includes aspects of geological uncertainty. The resulting simulations include alternate operational modes that are characterized by separate operational policies and tactics. The current DES framework has been customized to integrate predictive modelling data, generated via partial least squares (PLS) regression, in order to evaluate system-wide response to geological uncertainty. Sample computations that are based on data from Canada’s oil sands are presented, showing the framework to be a powerful tool to assess and attenuate operational risk factors in the extractive processing of bitumen deposits. Specifically, this work addresses blending control strategies prior to bitumen extraction and provides a pathway to incorporate geological variation into decision-making processes throughout the value chain. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to help researchers for building a common narrative about DT, we present an elaborated structure of DT, namely, spiral DTframework. Furthermore, for a secure and reliable management of the DT data, we propose using the blockchain technology rather than cloud or fog. As the classical blockchain suffers from transaction confirmation delays and is vulnerable to the quantum attacks, therefore, we propose a new variant of blockchain, namely twinchain, which is quantum-resilient and offers immediate transaction confirmation.

The condition of the manufacturing equipment may in fact lead to schedule unfeasibility or inefficiency, thus requiring responsiveness to preserve productivity and reduce the operational costs. In order to address current limitations of traditional scheduling methods, this work proposes a new framework that exploits the aggregation of several digital twins, representing different physical assets and their autonomous decision-making, together with a global digital twin, in order to perform production scheduling optimization when it is needed. The decision-making process is supported on a fuzzy inference system using the state or conditions of different assets and the production rate of the whole system. The condition of the assets is predicted by the condition-based monitoring modules in the local digital twins of the workstations, whereas the production rate is evaluated and assured by the global digital twin of the shop floor. This paper presents a framework for decentralized and integrated decision-making for re-scheduling of a cyber-physical production system, and the validation and proof-of-concept of the proposed method in an Industry 4.0 pilot line of assembly process.

This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization. Unlike traditional production control approaches, this novel approach integrates machine learning and real-time industrial big data to train and optimize digital twin models. It can support petrochemical and other process manufacturing industries to dynamically adapt to the changing environment, respond in a timely manner to changes in the market due to production optimization, and improve economic benefits. Accounting for environmental characteristics, this paper provides concrete solutions for machine learning difficulties in the petrochemical industry, e.g., high data dimensions, time lags and alignment between time series data, and high demand for immediacy.

Conventional oil and gas reserves are finite and are being depleted at a relatively rapid pace. With alternative fuels and technologies still unable to fill the gap, research and development of unconventional petroleum resources have accelerated markedly in the past 20 years. With some of the largest bitumen deposits in the world, Canada has an active oil mining and refining industry. Bitumen deposits, also called oil sands, are formed in complex geological environments and subject to a host of syn-and post-depositional processes. As a result, some ores are heterogeneous, at both individual reservoir and regional scales, which poses significant problems in terms of extractive processing. Moreover, with increased environmental awareness and enhanced governmental regulations and industry best practices, it is critical for oil sands producers to improve process efficiencies across the spectrum. Discrete event simulation (DES) is a computational paradigm to develop dynamic digital twins, including the interactions of critical variables and processes. In the case of mining systems, the digital twin includes aspects of geological uncertainty. The resulting simulations include alternate operational modes that are characterized by separate operational policies and tactics. The current DES framework has been customized to integrate predictive modelling data, generated via partial least squares (PLS) regression, in order to evaluate system-wide response to geological uncertainty. Sample computations that are based on data from Canada’s oil sands are presented, showing the framework to be a powerful tool to assess and attenuate operational risk factors in the extractive processing of bitumen deposits.

Over the years, numerous enterprises have promoted the implementation of both sustainable and smart manufacturing. In the Industry 4.0 context, a ‘digital twin’ is widely used to achieve smart manufacturing, although this approach often ignores sustainability. This study aims to simultaneously consider digital twin and big data technologies to propose a sustainable smart manufacturing strategy based on information management systems for energy-intensive industries (EIIs) from the product lifecycle perspective. The integration of digital twin and big data provides key technologies for data acquisition in energy-intensive production environments, prediction and mining in uncertain environments as well as real-time control in complex working conditions. Moreover, a digital twin-driven operation mechanism and an overall framework of big data cleansing and integration are designed to explain and illustrate sustainable smart manufacturing. Two case studies from Southern and Northern China demonstrate the efficacy of the strategy, with the results showing that Companies A and B achieved the goals of energy saving and cost reduction after implementing the proposed strategy. By applying an energy management system, the unit energy consumption and energy cost of production in Company A decreased by at least 3%. In addition, the ‘cradle-to-gate’ lifecycle big data analysis indicates that the costs of environmental protection in Company B decrease significantly.

Production control in petrochemical industry involves complex circumstances and a high demand for timeliness, therefore, agile and smart controls are important components of intelligent manufacturing in the petrochemical industry. This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization. Unlike traditional production control approaches, this novel approach integrates machine learning and real-time industrial big data to train and optimize digital twin models. It can support petrochemical and other process manufacturing industries to dynamically adapt to the changing environment, respond in a timely manner to changes in the market due to production optimization, and improve economic benefits. Accounting for environmental characteristics, this paper provides concrete solutions for machine learning difficulties in the petrochemical industry, e.g., high data dimensions, time lags and alignment between time series data, and high demand for immediacy. The approaches were evaluated by applying them in the production unit of a petrochemical factory, and a model was trained via industrial IoT data and used to realize intelligent production control based on real-time data.

Digital Twins help analyze and predict these systems in the form of digital reflections that operate in parallel with the physical system. In this paper, we use Machine Learning to improve the predictive power of Digital Twins for Cyber-Physical Energy Systems. Specifically, we use a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network model to learn the temporal patterns in the system and predict its responsiveness to specific power setpoint instructions. Real-life data from ten batteries were used to predict the behavior over time. Compared to the baseline model that uses the prior probability of response and the average response rate within the configured time window, the model predicts the batteries' responsiveness more accurately. The more temporal information is used as input for prediction, the better the model performs in both precision and recall. The results show that this compensates for the lack of information when fewer metrics are used.

However, the resulting representations can be excessively accurate and may also describe activities that are not significant for estimating the system performance. Generating models with an appropriate level of detail can avoid useless efforts and long computation times, while allowing for easier understanding and re-usability. This paper proposes a method to automatically discover manufacturing systems and generate adequate digital twins. The relevant characteristics of a production system are automatically retrieved from data logs. The proposed method has been applied on two test cases and a real manufacturing line. The experimental results prove its effectiveness in generating digital models that can correctly estimate the system performance. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",,Not started,Alex,"October 25, 2022 7:03 PM"

In this work, we aim to realize DTOs using action-oriented process mining, a collection of techniques to evaluate violations of constraints and produce the required actions. To this end, we suggest a digital twin interface model as a transparent representation of an organization describing the current state of business processes and possible configurations in underlying information systems. By interacting with the representation, process analysts can elicit constraints and actions that will be continuously monitored and triggered by an action engine to improve business processes.

Conventional oil and gas reserves are finite and are being depleted at a relatively rapid pace. With alternative fuels and technologies still unable to fill the gap, research and development of unconventional petroleum resources have accelerated markedly in the past 20 years. With some of the largest bitumen deposits in the world, Canada has an active oil mining and refining industry. Bitumen deposits, also called oil sands, are formed in complex geological environments and subject to a host of syn-and post-depositional processes. As a result, some ores are heterogeneous, at both individual reservoir and regional scales, which poses significant problems in terms of extractive processing. Moreover, with increased environmental awareness and enhanced governmental regulations and industry best practices, it is critical for oil sands producers to improve process efficiencies across the spectrum. Discrete event simulation (DES) is a computational paradigm to develop dynamic digital twins, including the interactions of critical variables and processes. In the case of mining systems, the digital twin includes aspects of geological uncertainty. The resulting simulations include alternate operational modes that are characterized by separate operational policies and tactics. The current DES framework has been customized to integrate predictive modelling data, generated via partial least squares (PLS) regression, in order to evaluate system-wide response to geological uncertainty. Sample computations that are based on data from Canada’s oil sands are presented, showing the framework to be a powerful tool to assess and attenuate operational risk factors in the extractive processing of bitumen deposits. Specifically, this work addresses blending control strategies prior to bitumen extraction and provides a pathway to incorporate geological variation into decision-making processes throughout the value chain. © 2021 by the authors.

As one of the most important applications for IoT, sustainable smart manufacturing enables lower cost, higher productivity and flexibility, better quality and sustainability during the product lifecycle management. Over the years, numerous enterprises have promoted the implementation of both sustainable and smart manufacturing. In the Industry 4.0 context, a ‘digital twin’ is widely used to achieve smart manufacturing, although this approach often ignores sustainability. This study aims to simultaneously consider digital twin and big data technologies to propose a sustainable smart manufacturing strategy based on information management systems for energy-intensive industries (EIIs) from the product lifecycle perspective. The integration of digital twin and big data provides key technologies for data acquisition in energy-intensive production environments, prediction and mining in uncertain environments as well as real-time control in complex working conditions. Moreover, a digital twin-driven operation mechanism and an overall framework of big data cleansing and integration are designed to explain and illustrate sustainable smart manufacturing. Two case studies from Southern and Northern China demonstrate the efficacy of the strategy, with the results showing that Companies A and B achieved the goals of energy saving and cost reduction after implementing the proposed strategy. By applying an energy management system, the unit energy consumption and energy cost of production in Company A decreased by at least 3%. In addition, the ‘cradle-to-gate’ lifecycle big data analysis indicates that the costs of environmental protection in Company B decrease significantly.

This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization.
