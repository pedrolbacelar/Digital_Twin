"""
Shared resources supporting priorities and preemption.

These resources can be used to limit the number of processes using them
concurrently. A process needs to *request* the usage right to a resource. Once
the usage right is not needed anymore it has to be *released*. A gas station
can be modelled as a resource with a limited amount of fuel-pumps. Vehicles
arrive at the gas station and request to use a fuel-pump. If all fuel-pumps are
in use, the vehicle needs to wait until one of the users has finished refueling
and releases its fuel-pump.

These resources can be used by a limited number of processes at a time.
Processes *request* these resources to become a user and have to *release* them
once they are done. For example, a gas station with a limited number of fuel
pumps can be modeled with a `Resource`. Arriving vehicles request a fuel-pump.
Once one is available they refuel. When they are done, the release the
fuel-pump and leave the gas station.

Requesting a resource is modelled as "putting a process' token into the
resources" and releasing a resources correspondingly as "getting a process'
token out of the resource". Thus, calling ``request()``/``release()`` is
equivalent to calling ``put()``/``get()``. Note, that releasing a resource will
always succeed immediately, no matter if a process is actually using a resource
or not.

Besides :class:`Resource`, there is a :class:`PriorityResource`, where
processes can define a request priority, and a :class:`PreemptiveResource`
whose resource users can be preempted by requests with a higher priority.
