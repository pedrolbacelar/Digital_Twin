A consistency evaluation method for digital twin models,"Digital twin has shown its great application values in various fields in the past few years, especially manufacturing. During the process of digital twin implementation, the digital twin model is one of the most important foundations. Because the effectiveness and accuracy of digital twin models could directly affect the quality of related services. Nowadays, some efforts have been made on digital twin modeling methods, e.g. multi-disciplinary modeling method, multi-dimension modeling method, and multi-scale modeling method. Besides, the research on Industrial Internet of Things makes it possible to realize the synchronization between digital twin models and the corresponding physical objects. However, the attention on how to conduct a comprehensive consistency evaluation between the models and corresponding physical objects is not enough. Against the background, this paper proposed a consistency evaluation framework towards digital twin shop-floor (DTS) models. The consistency evaluation method mainly contains two phases, i.e. before and after model assembly and model fusion. Before model assembly and model fusion, the geometry models, physics models, behavior models, and rule models are mainly considered. After model assembly and fusion, the overall performance of assembled models and fusion models is paid more attention. Furthermore, the analytic hierarchy process(AHP) is used to form a comprehensive consistency evaluation result for DTS models. At last, a specific application scenario in complex product AIT (Assembly, Integration and Test) shop-floor is given to explain how to apply the proposed framework and method. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2022,Analytic hierarchy process Assembly Floors Consistency Evaluation methods Model assembly Model fusion Model method Model validation Model verification Multi-disciplinary modeling Physical objects Shopfloors Industrial researchConsistency Digital twin Model validation Model verification Shop-floor,academic,"School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100083, China; Shenyuan Hornors College, Beihang University, Beijing, 100083, China; Digital Twin International Research Center, International Research Institute for Multidisciplinary Science, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China",8,0.3125

A multi-scale modeling method for digital twin shop-floor,"Digital twin has attracted more and more attentions in the past few years. To put digital twin into practice, modeling is one of the most important foundations. Under this background, some modeling research on digital twin shop-floor which is regarded as the basic unit for realizing smart manufacturing has been carried out. However, current research pays scant attention to the multi-scale features of shop-floor, which hinders the effective application of digital twin shop-floor. As for the problem about how to realize the model construction from the perspective of time-scale and space-scale, this paper firstly proposed a multi-layer modeling framework for supporting model construction from unit layer to system layer to system of system layer. Moreover, the mechanism of model changes over time is also considered. Then, the specific procedures and methods of model assembly, model fusion and model update towards machines and shop-floor are discussed respectively. Finally, a satellite AIT(Assembly, Integration and Test) shop-floor is chosen as the case to validate the correctness and feasibility of proposed framework, procedures and methods. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2022,Floors Digital twin shop-floor Model assembly Model construction Model fusion Model method Model updates Modeling Multiscale modeling Shopfloors System layer Industrial researchDigital twin Digital twin shop-floor Model assembly Model fusion Model update Modeling,academic,"School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China; Shenyuan Hornors College, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",8,0.36363636363636365
Multidimensional data modeling and model validation for digital twin workshop,"Digital twin workshop (DTW) is an important embodiment of intelligent manufacturing in the workshop level, which enables the smart production control and management of the workshop. However, there still exist problems including data modeling and verification of digital model in the process of DTW construction. To solve these problem, multidimensional data modeling and model validation methods of DTW are proposed in this article. First, five-order tensor models for representing manufacturing elements are established to unify the data from physical workshop (PW) and virtual workshop (VW). Then, the mathematical method for verifying DTW twin model is proposed from the recessive and explicit perspective. Finally, a case study of an aerospace machining workshop is carried out to verify the operability and effectiveness of the proposed method. The case analysis shows that the proposed methods can effectively evaluate whether the twin model accurately provides the description of the actual behavior process of physical workshop, and the proposed methods have good performance. © 2021 by ASTM International.",2021,Digital twin Information analysis Production control Behavior process Control and management Intelligent Manufacturing Mathematical method Model validation Modeling and verifications Multidimensional data modeling Virtual workshops Manufacture,academic,"College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, 210016, China; China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, Beijing, 100076, China",8,0.2692307692307692
Theory of digital twin modeling and its application; [数字孪生模型构建理论及应用],"Digital twin is a hot point nowadays, and has received great attention from both academia and industry. The first problem faced by users when utilizing digital twin is how to realize the modeling of a digital twin. However, model is a core part in any digital twin as well as its industrial application. Unfortunately, there is no criterion for digital twin modelling until now, and it lacks theoretical support for accurate modeling when studying and utilizing digital twin. For addressing this problem, the modelling criterion of digital twin was put forward. Then a theoretical system for digital twin modelling was established from six aspects, including model construction, model assembly, model fusion, model verification, model validation and model management. The proposed criterion and theory for digital twin modelling were applied in the construction of Digital Twin Shop-floor (DTS). Furthermore, three key technologies in DTS, including modeling of shop-floor elements, modeling of data-driven dynamic production process and modeling of production system simulation were studied in detail.These works were expected to provide theoretical references for the construction and application of digital twin in different industrial fields, especially in shop-floor. © 2021, Editorial Department of CIMS.

Conceiving a Digital Twin for a Flexible Manufacturing System,"Digitization and virtualization represent key factors in the era of Industry 4.0. Digital twins (DT) can certainly contribute to increasing the efficiency of various productive sectors as they can contribute to monitoring, managing, and improvement of a product or process throughout its life cycle. Although several works deal with DTs, there are gaps regarding the use of this technology when a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) is used. Existing work, for the most part, is concerned with simulating the progress of manufacturing without providing key production data in real-time. Still, most of the solutions presented in the literature are relatively expensive and may be difficult to implement in most companies, due to their complexity. In this work, the digital twin of an FMS is conceived. The specific module of an ERP (Enterprise Resources Planning) system is used to digitize the physical entity. Production data is entered according to tryouts performed in the FMS. Sensors installed in the main components of the FMS, CNC (computer numerical control) lathe, robotic arm, and pallet conveyor send information in real-time to the digital entity. The results show that simulations using the digital twin present very satisfactory results compared to the physical entity. In time, information such as production rate, queue management, feedstock, equipment, and pallet status can be easily accessed by operators and managers at any time during the production process, confirming the MES (manufacture execution system) efficiency. The low-cost hardware and software used in this work showed its feasibility. The DT created represents the initial step towards designing a metaverse solution for the manufacturing unit in question, which should operate in the near future as a smart and autonomous factory model. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,digital twin flexible manufacturing system Industry 4.0 simulation,academic,"Department of Industrial Technology, Federal University of Espírito Santo, Av.

The digital twin in Industry 4.0: A wide-angle perspective,"The move towards advanced manufacturing and Industry 4.0 is fed by increased demand for speeding up innovation, increasing flexibility, improving maintenance, and becoming more customized while saving on the total cost of operations. This is accompanied by increased dependence on virtual product and process development, data-driven processes, and product knowledge. Other characteristics, affecting modern design, include big data intelligence in product, process, and maintenance. New technologies that empower data analytics include added manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, robotics, sensor technology, smart value/supply chains, and industrial information backbones. This paper is about surrogate models, also called digital twins, that provide an important complementary capacity to physical assets. Digital twins capture past, present, and predicted behavior of physical assets. Digital twin models are updated periodically to represent the current state of physical assets. This distinguishes digital twins from conventional simulations in that sensor data can continuously feed them. The type of curated information on the state of physical asset's history depends on how digital twins are used. For example, if a digital twin is used for fault classification, the history captured is operational data from equipment in healthy and faulty states. We provide here a review of digital twins, with an emphasis on Industry 4.0 applications. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2022,Data Analytics Flexible manufacturing systems Industrial robots Industry 4.0 Product design Advanced manufacturing Cost of operations Data intelligence Fault classification Flexible manufacturing Process development Product knowledge Sensor technologies Digital twincondition-based maintenance digital twins Industry 4.0 information quality model calibration process control simulations,academic,"KPA Group, Raanana and Samuel Neaman Institute, Technion–Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel",18,0.21428571428571427
Digitalized Automation Engineering of Industry 4.0 Production Systems and Their Tight Cooperation with Digital Twins,"Smart production systems conforming the Industry 4.0 vision are based on subsystems that are integrated in a way that supports high flexibility and re-configurability. Specific components and devices, such as industrial and mobile robots or transport systems, now pose full-blown systems, and the entire Industry 4.0 production system constitutes a system-of-systems. Testing, fine-tuning, and production planning are important tasks in the entire engineering production system life-cycle. All these steps can be significantly supported and improved by digital twins, which are digitalized replicas of physical systems that are synchronized with the real systems at runtime. However, the design and implementation of digital twins for such integrated, yet partly stand-alone, industrial sub-systems can represent challenging and significantly time-consuming engineering tasks. In this article, the problem of the digital twin design for discrete-event production systems is addressed. The article also proposes to utilize a formal description of production resources and related production operations that the resources can perform. An executable version of such formalization can be automatically derived into a form of a digital twin. Such a derived digital twin can be enhanced with operation duration times that are obtained with process mining methods, leading to more realistic simulations for the entire production system. The proposed solution was successfully tested and validated in the Industry 4.0 Testbed, equipped with four robots and a transport system, which is utilized as a use-case in this article. © 2022 by the authors.

Digital Twin-Assisted Controlling of AGVs in Flexible Manufacturing Environments,"Digital Twins are increasingly being introduced for smart manufacturing systems to improve the efficiency of the main disciplines of such systems. Formal techniques, such as graphs, are a common way of describing Digital Twin models, allowing broad types of tools to provide Digital Twin based services such as fault detection in production lines. Obtaining correct and complete formal Digital Twins of physical systems can be a complicated and time consuming process, particularly for manufacturing systems with plenty of physical objects and the associated manufacturing processes. Automatic generation of Digital Twins is an emerging research field and can reduce time and costs. In this paper, we focus on the generation of Digital Twins for flexible manufacturing systems with Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) on the factory floor. In particular, we propose an architectural framework and the associated design choices and software development tools that facilitate automatic generation of Digital Twins for AGVs. Specifically, the scope of the generated digital twins is controlling AGVs in the factory floor. To this end, we focus on different control levels of AGVs and utilize graph theory to generate the graph-based Digital Twin of the factory floor. © 2021 IEEE.",2021,Automatic guided vehicles Fault detection Flexible manufacturing systems Floors Software design Agile manufacturing Automated guided vehicles Automatic Generation Factory floors Flexible manufacturing Layer controls Manufacturing environments Multi-layer control Multi-layers Smart manufacturing Graph theoryagile manufacturing AGV digital twin graph theory industry 4.0 multi-layer control,academic,"Aalto University, Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Espoo, Finland; University of Oslo, Department of Informatics, Oslo, Norway",18,0.20930232558139536

A Digital Twin Demonstrator to enable flexible manufacturing with robotics: a process supervision case study,"Manufacturing companies are facing different challenges. On the one hand, production is moving from mass-production to mass-customization and personalization. Reconfigurable-, adaptive- and evolving-factories are necessary to achieve the required flexibility. On the other hand, technology must be integrated with human skills to assist the operators in supervising and maintaining manufacturing plants with growing complexity. In line with the Industry 4.0 paradigm, a Digital Twin Demonstrator is proposed to support the supervision activity of the operator in the context of flexible manufacturing with robotics. The supervision is achieved through a Human-Computer-Machine Interaction (HCMI) enabled with the Digital Twin technology. The suggested demonstrator is implemented and validated using a lab case study where it is demonstrated how the proposed HCMI interaction enables ‘close-to-real-time’ supervision of the manufacturing system in its self-adaptation to production and environmental changes. © 2021 The Author(s).

Automated digital twins generation for manufacturing systems: A case study,"The recent industrial scenario was defined by the emergence of digital twins and cyber physical systems as key elements for manufacturers leadership. Digital models can perform good in terms of production planning and control decisions if they are correctly representing their physical counterparts at anytime. Discrete event simulation can be considered as established digital models of manufacturing system, thanks to the proven capabilities of correctly estimating the system performances. Automated simulation model generation techniques can significantly reduce model development phases and allow for using simulation models for short term decisions in production. Application studies and test cases are scarce in the literature. In this paper, we present the application of a digital model generation method. The test case is done exploiting a lab-scale model of a manufacturing system composed by six stations. We investigate how the model generation works online, during the transient phase of a manufacturing system. Results confirm the real-time applicability of the approach provided that sufficient data points are available from the production event logs. © 2021 The Authors.

A simulator coupling architecture for the creation of digital twins,"Digital Twins are digital representations of real-world entities. Their behavior resembles the behavior of the real entity at all times. They are candidates for the evaluation of complex adaptive embedded systems, for example in the domains of autonomous driving, or industry 4.0 production systems. However, as most simulators are specialized and only simulate selected aspects of a system with highest accuracy, the creation of a Digital Twin requires the coupling of simulators and their simulation models. Related work indicates that this is still a labor-intensive and manual task. In this paper, we present an architecture framework that transfers approaches from Component-Based Software Engineering to simulator coupling. Simulators are encapsulated as simulation components with defined interfaces. The creation of a Digital Twin is supported by orchestrating simulation components.

A digital twin ecosystem for additive manufacturing using a real-time development platform,"Additive manufacturing is often used in rapid prototyping and manufacturing, allowing the creation of lighter, more complex designs that are difficult or too expensive to build using traditional manufacturing methods. This work considers the implementation of a novel digital twin ecosystem that can be used for testing, process monitoring, and remote management of an additive manufacturing–fused deposition modeling machine in a simulated virtual environment. The digital twin ecosystem is comprised of two approaches. One approach is data-driven by an open-source 3D printer web controller application that is used to capture its status and key parameters. The other approach is data-driven by externally mounted sensors to approximate the actual behavior of the 3D printer and achieve accurate synchronization between the physical and virtual 3D printers. We evaluate the sensor-data-driven approach against the web controller approach, which is considered to be the ground truth. We achieve near-real-time synchronization between the physical machine and its digital counterpart and have validated the digital twin in terms of position, temperature, and run duration. Our digital twin ecosystem is cost-efficient, reliable, replicable, and hence can be utilized to provide legacy equipment with digital twin capabilities, collect historical data, and generate analytics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2022,Deposition Ecosystems Process monitoring Simulation platform Virtual reality Data driven Deposition modeling Development platform Fused deposition modeling Manufacturing IS Rapid-prototyping Real- time Simulation Time development Unity 3d 3D printersAdditive manufacturing Digital twin Fused deposition modeling Simulation Unity 3D,academic,"Industrial and Systems Engineering, Auburn University, 357-359 W Magnolia Ave, Auburn, 36832, AL, United States",57,0.23684210526315788
A Digital Twin Approach for the Prediction of the Geometry of Single Tracks Produced by Laser Metal Deposition,"Flexible manufacturing processes such as laser metal deposition exhibit high potential for a production solely defined by software to cope with the current challenges of production systems.

However, the big data-driven product design mainly places emphasis on the analysis of physical data rather than the virtual models, in other words, the convergence between product physical and virtual space is usually absent. Digital twin, a new emerging and fast growing technology which connects the physical and virtual world, has attracted much attention worldwide recently. This paper presents a new method for product design based on the digital twin approach. The development of product design is briefly introduced first. The framework of digital twin-driven product design (DTPD) is then proposed and analysed. A case is presented to illustrate the application of the proposed DTPD method. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,Big data Life cycle Virtual reality Data lifecycle Design theory digital twin framework Product design frameworks Virtual models Virtual spaces Virtual worlds Product designbig data data lifecycle design theory digital twin framework product design,academic,"School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineerig, Beihang University, Beijing, China; School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States; Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore",70,0.20588235294117646
Digital twin-based job shop anomaly detection and dynamic scheduling,"Scheduling scheme is one of the critical factors affecting the production efficiency. In the actual production, anomalies will lead to scheduling deviation and influence scheme execution, which makes the traditional job shop scheduling methods are not sufficient to meet the needs of real-time and accuracy. By introducing digital twin (DT), further convergence between physical and virtual space can be achieved, which enormously reinforces real-time performance of job shop scheduling. For flexible job shop, an anomaly detection and dynamic scheduling framework based on DT is proposed in this paper. Previously, a multi-level production process monitoring model is proposed to detect anomaly. Then, a real-time optimization strategy of scheduling scheme based on rolling window mechanism is explored to enforce dynamic scheduling optimization. Finally, the improved grey wolf optimization algorithm is introduced to solve the scheduling problem. Under this framework, it is possible to monitor the deviation between the actual processing state and the planned processing state in real time and effectively reduce the deviation. An equipment manufacturing job shop is taken as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed framework. © 2022",2023,Anomaly detection Dynamics Job shop scheduling Process control Production efficiency Digital twin Gray wolf optimization algorithm Gray wolves Level productions Monitoring models Multi-level production process monitoring model Multilevels Optimization algorithms Optimization strategy Production process Real time scheduling Real-time scheduling optimization strategy Rolling window Rolling window mechanism Scheduling optimization Process monitoringDigital twin (DT) Grey wolf optimization algorithm Multi-level production process monitoring model Real-time scheduling optimization strategy Rolling window mechanism,academic,"School of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Production Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden; Hubei Digital Manufacturing Key Laboratory, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, 430070, China",72,0.20588235294117646
Digital twin-based production scheduling system for heavy truck frame shop,"Existing scheduling systems cannot respond quickly and efficiently to the appearance of uncertain variable interference factors in the scheduling process. The efficiency of the enterprise is hence seriously affected by these factors. The concept of the digital twin provides new research directions for scheduling systems. In order to improve the overall performance of the production scheduling system in a frame shop, virtual-real fusion technology utilizing the digital twin is first introduced to integrate the information and logistics flows in the scheduling process as part of the manufacturing execution system-based production scheduling mechanism. The balance optimization of the mixed-flow production line is then carried out, and the mixed-flow production line balance and sequencing models are established. A scheduling system for the frame shop combining various system functions is finally designed based on the sequencing model and production status. The scheduling system comprehensively considers the two uncertain factors of materials and orders to generate scheduling information through an intelligent scheduling mode while realizing real-time synergy between the information and logistics flows. The system has achieved excellent implementation results in the frame shop and provides a reference for the application of digital twins in production workshops. © IMechE 2020.",2022,Digital twin Manufacture Production control Balance optimization Intelligent scheduling Interference factor Manufacturing Execution System Production Scheduling Production scheduling system Production workshops Scheduling information SchedulingDigital twin mixed flow production line balance production system sorting model virtual-real fusion,academic,"School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an University of Science and Technology, Shaanxi, China",72,0.25

Real-time workshop digital twin scheduling platform for discrete manufacturing,"Compared with other production methods, multi-variety, small-batch production driven by order become a lot more sensitive to the disturbances of workshop environment, orders, and processing equipment. This makes a great impact on workshop scheduling. Aiming at this problem, this paper designs a real-time workshop digital twin scheduling platform for discrete manufacturing. It improves the flexibility of the intelligent workshop and the response processing speed after dynamic disturbance. The platform can real-time monitor of the physical workshop and track orders, products, equipment and other information. Further, the platform and visualization technology were explored to work together. Then, the true display of changes after production line decision was displayed. It enables managers to carry out production scheduling verification in the virtual workshop, which reduces the repeated changes of physical workshop production scheduling. Finally, the platform was verified in a discrete manufacturing workshop. The scheduling platform based on digital twins helps manager to immersivity develop factory production strategies.

Typology of Manufacturing Digital Twins: A First Step Towards a Deployment Methodology,"The digital twin is not only a recent technology but also a polymorphic concept which generates a profusion of publications without real coherence because they relate to very different realities including various definitions, shapes, models and applications. If a wide variety of architectures are proposed, there is a significant lack of information on how to deploy a digital twin efficiently and how to define an appropriate architecture. We propose the first step of a complete deployment methodology consisting of a typology that defines the main criteria required to determine not only the digital twin components but also their organization. Based on different recent works that have been synthesized and completed, eleven criteria have been selected as representative of the set of usages and applications proposed in the literature.

Digital Twins for the built environment: learning from conceptual and process models in manufacturing,"The overall aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm in the built environment by drawing inspiration from existing DT research in manufacturing. The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT's structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors. © 2021",2021,Architectural design Digital twin E-learning Embedded systems Engineering education Information theory Manufacture Academic publications Building Information Modelling Communication models Cyber-physical systems (CPS) Product life managements Research frameworks Service-based model System architectures Industrial researchBIM Conceptual Models Cyber-Physical Systems Digital Twin Maturity Models Process Models,academic,"Big Data Enterprise and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Faculty of Business and Law, University of West of England (UWE) Bristol, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol, BS16 1QY, United Kingdom",100,0.27906976744186046

5-dimensional definition for a manufacturing digital twin,"The Digital Twin is a recently developed innovative technology in Industry 4.0. The cyber-physical system (CPS) is a concept closely connected with Industry 4.0 that can form a basis for creating a Digital Twin. In this paper, a comprehensive model of a Digital Twin approach for a manufacturing environment and related production processes is proposed. The presented model is based on combining a 5-Dimensional definition for the Digital Twin and cloud-based CPS (C2PS) architecture. The model consists of five layers to replicate the physical object as a virtual object and to collect and convert data. Analysis of the virtual model for prediction of future development, decision-making, re-configuration, what-if analysis, and understanding of the effect of changes in the real time process is performed in the fourth layer. The user interface layer is the connection between the virtual and physical model. Use of a Digital Twin in manufacturing enables improvement in the effectiveness of Lean Manufacturing, leading to savings in resources such as cost and time. Uncertainties inherent in manufacturing processes mean that the Digital Twin approach is a more suitable method for optimization of the overall process and the sub-processes than pure simulation. An accurate Digital Twin model can improve safety, save costs, speed up manufacturing of new products and implementation of new processes, and provide global optimization results. In practice, however, provision of data is a challenge to use of the Digital Twin approach because modern manufacturing uses a variety of data in different formats with different owners. Access to all required data and information and obtaining permission for its use in creation of a Digital Twin is a topic for future research. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using open-source microcontrollers to enable digital twin communication for smart manufacturing,"One of the key enabling technologies for the smart factory is the Digital Twin, which can be described as a digital model of a physical entity. In smart manufacturing, a digital twin, also referred to as a cyber-physical production system, comprises three integrated components: the product, the process and the machine. In this paper, the design, fabrication and development of a proof of principal manufacturing digital twin demonstrator is discussed. The manufacturing process is a V-bending operation of a thin metallic plate. All three components of a manufacturing digital twin are represented: the metallic plate product, the bending process and the bending machine. Low-cost, IoT-enabled, open-source microcontrollers are used to communicate between the physical and the digital twins. The microcontroller is used to control machine operations, while also extracting sensor data from the system. It is demonstrated that the digital twin enables real-time stress prediction in the product during the bending process, while also tracking and recording machine performance. An information dashboard has also been developed which presents key performance indicators to the end user. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Construction of intelligent integrated model framework for the workshop manufacturing system via digital twin,"With the boosting development of the advanced manufacturing industry in the world, the original production pattern transformed from the traditional industries into the intelligence mode is completed with the least delay possible, which are still facing new challenges. The timeliness, stability, and reliability of them are significantly restricted due to the lack of real-time communication. Therefore, a model framework of intelligent workshop manufacturing system based on a digital twin is proposed in this paper, driving the deep information integration among the physical entity, data collection, and information decision-making. The traditional digital twin of conceptualization and fuzziness needs to be refined, optimized, and upgraded on the basis of the four-dimension collaborative model thinking. The model framework of a refined nine-layer intelligent digital twin is established. Firstly, the physical evaluation is refined into entity layer, auxiliary layer, and interface layer, scientific managing the physical resources and the instrument, and coordinating the overall system. Secondly, dividing the data evaluation into the data layer and the processing layer can greatly improve the flexible response-ability and ensure the synchronization of the real-time data. Finally, the system evaluation is subdivided into information layer, algorithm layer, scheduling layer, and functional layer, developing flexible manufacturing plan more reasonably, shortening the production cycle, and reducing logistics cost. Simultaneously, combining SLP and artificial bee colonies is applied to investigate the production system optimization of the textile workshop.

Improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation: application in a digital twin shop floor,"In recent years, the literature has paid considerable attention to digital twin technology for the implementation of Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing. Most of the literature argues that simulation models are a key platform for digital twins and considers discrete-event simulation to be a suitable method to model real dynamic manufacturing systems. However, the discrete-event simulation of complex manufacturing systems is a time-consuming process. Therefore, it is difficult to deal with the large-scale discrete optimisation problems in digital twin shop floors. To bridge this research gap, we propose an improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation method based on multi-fidelity optimisation with ordinal transformation and optimal sampling (MO2TOS) in the current research. The proposed method embeds heuristic algorithms to accelerate the solution space search efficiency in MO2TOS. Moreover, we develop an improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation system by integrating the proposed method with discrete-event simulation tools and apply this system to a digital twin-based aircraft parts production workshop. Based on this digital twin shop floor, we conduct different production planning experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation method is well-applied in solving large-scale problems and outperforms other simulation-based optimisation methods. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,Discrete event simulation Floors Heuristic algorithms Heuristic methods Manufacture Optimization Production control Complex manufacturing systems Discrete optimisation Intelligent Manufacturing Large-scale problem Multi-fidelity simulation Production Planning Production workshops Simulation based optimisation Digital twindigital twin shop floor heuristic algorithms large-scale problem optimisation Multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation simulation,academic,"School of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; EMLYON Business School, Ecully, France",133,0.36363636363636365

Digital twin-driven rapid reconfiguration of the automated manufacturing system via an open architecture model,"Increasing individualization demands in products call for high flexibility in the manufacturing systems to adapt changes. This paper proposes a novel digital twin-driven approach for rapid reconfiguration of automated manufacturing systems. The digital twin comprises two parts, the semi-physical simulation that maps data of the system and provides input data to the second part, which is optimization. The results of the optimization part are fed back to the semi-physical simulation for verification. Open-architecture machine tool (OAMT) is defined and developed as a new class of machine tools comprising a fixed standard platform and various individualized modules that can be added and rapidly swapped. Engineers can flexibly reconfigure the manufacturing system for catering to process planning by integrating personalized modules into its OAMTs. Key enabling techniques, including how to twin cyber and physical system and how to quickly bi-level program the production capacity and functionality of manufacturing systems to adapt rapid changes of products, are detailed. A physical implementation is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach to achieving improved system performance while minimizing the overheads of the reconfiguration process by automating and rapidly optimizing it. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,Architecture Computer aided manufacturing Cyber Physical System Embedded systems Fixed platforms Machine tools Reconfigurable architectures Automated manufacturing systems Digital twin Enabling techniques Open architecture Reconfigurable manufacturing system Reconfiguration process Semi-physical simulations Smart manufacturing ManufactureCyber-physical system Digital twin Industrial internet of things Open architecture Reconfigurable manufacturing system Smart manufacturing,academic,"Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Integrated Manufacturing System, State Key Laboratory of Precision Electronic Manufacturing Technology and Equipment, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, 510006, Guangdong, China; Department of Information Systems, City University of Hong Kong, 999077, Hong Kong, China; School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an University of Science and Technology, Xian, 710054, China; School of Mechanical Engineering, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, 214122, China",143,0.25

A digital twin-driven production management system for production workshop,"With the rapid development of smart manufacturing, some challenges are emerging in the production management, including the utilization of information technology and the elimination of dynamic disturbance. A digital twin-driven production management system (DTPMS) can dynamically simulate and optimize production processes in manufacturing and achieve real-time synchronization, high fidelity, and real-virtual fusion in cyber-physical production. This paper focuses on establishing DTPMS for production life-cycle management. First, we illustrate how to integrate digital twin technology and simulation platforms. Second, a framework of DTPMS is proposed to support a cyber-physical system of production workshop, including product design, product manufacturing, and intelligent service management. Finally, the proposed DTPMS is applied to the production process of a heavy-duty vehicle gearbox. The experimental results indicate that the defective rate of products and the in-process inventory are reduced by 34% and 89%, respectively, while the one-time pass rate of product inspection is increased by 14.2%, which demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the DTPMS. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2020,Cyber Physical System Digital twin Embedded systems Industrial management Manufacture Product design Dynamic disturbances In-process inventories Intelligent Services Product manufacturing Production management Production management systems Production workshops Smart manufacturing Life cycleDigital twin Heavy-duty vehicle gearbox Production management Smart workshop,academic,"Key Laboratory of Contemporary Design and Integrated Manufacturing Technology, Ministry of Education, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi’an, 710072, China; Chongqing Tiema Industries Group Co.

Digital twins for high-tech machining applications—a model-based analytics-ready approach,"This paper presents a brief introduction to competition-driven digital transformation in the machining sector. On this basis, the creation of a digital twin for machining processes is approached firstly using a basic digital twin structure. The latter is sub-grouped into information and data models, specific calculation and process models, all seen from an application-oriented perspective. Moreover, digital shadow and digital twin are embedded in this framework, being discussed in the context of a state-of-the-art literature review. The main part of this paper addresses models for machine and path inaccuracies, material removal and tool engagement, cutting force, process stability, thermal behavior, workpiece and surface properties. Furthermore, these models are superimposed towards an integral digital twin. In addition, the overall context is expanded towards an integral software architecture of a digital twin providing information system. The information system, in turn, ties in with existing forward-oriented planning from operational practice, leading to a significant expansion of the initially presented basic structure for a digital twin. Consequently, a time-stratified data layer platform is introduced to prepare for the resulting shadow-twin transformation loop. Finally, subtasks are defined to assure functional interfaces, model integrability and feedback measures. © 2021 by the authors.

Improvement of factory planning by automated generation of a digital twin,"The simulation of processes in production systems is a powerful tool for factory planning. The application of simulation methods within the Digital Factory is becoming increasingly relevant as developments in the field of digitalization lead to more comprehensive, efficient, embedded and cost-effective simulation methods. Especially the integration within a Digital Twin, allows these advantages to be achieved for simulations.

"Digital twin of mRNA-based SARS-COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing towards autonomous operation for improvements in speed, scale, robustness, flexibility and real-time release testing","Supplying SARS-COVID-19 vaccines in quantities to meet global demand has a bottleneck in manufacturing capacity. Assessment of existing mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccine processing shows the need for digital twins enabled by process analytical technology approaches to improve process transfers for manufacturing capacity multiplication, reduction of out-of-specification batch failures, qualified personnel training for faster validation and efficient operation, optimal utilization of scarce buffers and chemicals, and faster product release. A digital twin of the total pDNA (plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid) to mRNA process is proposed. In addition, a first feasibility of multisensory process analytical technology (PAT) is shown. Process performance characteristics are derived as results and evaluated regarding manufacturing technology bottlenecks. Potential improvements could be pointed out such as dilution reduction in lysis, and potential reduction of necessary chromatography steps. 1 g pDNA may lead to about 30 g mRNA. This shifts the bottleneck towards the mRNA processing step, which points out co-transcriptional capping as a preferred option to reduce the number of purification steps. Purity demands are fulfilled by a combination of mixed-mode and reversed-phase chromatography as established unit operations on a higher industrial readiness level than e.g., precipitation and ethanol-chloroform extraction. As a final step, lyophilization was chosen for stability, storage and transportation logistics. Alternative process units like UF/DF (ultra-/diafiltration) integration would allow the adjustment of final concentration and buffer composition before lipid-nano particle (LNP) formulation. The complete digital twin is proposed for further validation in manufacturing scale and utilization in process optimization and manufacturing operations. The first PAT results should be followed by detailed investigation of different batches and processing steps in order to implement this strategy for process control and reliable, efficient operation. © 2021 by the authors.

At the same time, it is worth noting that the role of standards in creating “digital mines” and “mines of the future” is difficult to overestimate. Digitalization and standardization are closely interrelated processes. The only correct way to integrate the devices, information systems and digital models used in mining enterprises is based primarily on technical standards and regulations, which in turn strengthen the Foundation for intelligent digital production in the industry. In order to ensure the compatibility of mining and geological, mining and technological and technical parameters, intelligent management systems and data analysis, as well as the interaction of various departments of mining enterprises with government services, it is necessary to create industry standards for digital production.

A Novel Implementation Framework of Digital Twins for Intelligent Manufacturing Based on Container Technology and Cloud Manufacturing Services,"Many core technologies of Industry 4.0 have gained substantial advancement in recent years. Digital Twin (DT) has become the key technology and tool for manufacturing industries to realize intelligent cyber-physical integration and digital transformation by leveraging these technologies. Although there have been many DT-related works, there is no standard definition, unified framework, and implementation approach of DT until now. Widely developing DTs for the manufacturing industry is still challenging. Thus, this paper proposes a novel implementation framework of digital twins for intelligent manufacturing, denoted as IF-DTiM, which possesses several distinct merits to distinguish itself from previous works. First, IF-DTiM fully utilizes new-generation container technology so that DT-related applications and services can be packaged in a self-contained way, rapidly deployed, and robustly operated with the capabilities of failover, autoscaling, and load balancing. Second, it leverages existing intelligent cloud manufacturing services to realize the intelligence for DT externally in a scalable and plug-and-play manner instead of using traditional approaches to embed intelligence in DT. Third, IF-DTiM contains Product DT for products, Equipment DT (i.e., EQ DT) for equipment, and Process DT for production lines, which can generically fulfill the demands and scenarios to achieve intelligent manufacturing for various manufacturing industries. Testing results show that IF-DTiM can achieve remarkable performance in rapid deployment and real-time data exchanges of DT-related applications. Finally, we develop an example DTiM system for CNC machining based on IF-DTiM to demonstrate its efficacy and applicability in facilitating the manufacturing industry to build their DT systems. Note to Practitioners - Developing Digital Twin (DT) systems to realize intelligent manufacturing is challenging. The proposed IF-DTiM (Implementation Framework of Digital Twins for Intelligent Manufacturing) provides a novel container-technology and cloud-manufacturing-service-based systematic methodology for building DTiM. In this paper, we present the system architecture and several operational scenarios (e.g., how to create and use DTs) of IF-DTiM, together with the design of its core functional mechanisms (e.g., rapid deployment scheme for DT, real-time data exchange for DT, DT interface pattern, and general workflow architecture for DT). Also, an example DTiM system for CNC machining based on IF-DTiM is presented to facilitate the practitioners to adopt the designs and niches in IF-DTiM to build their desired DTiM systems.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",2022,Computer aided manufacturing Electronic data interchange Industry 4.0 Cloud Manufacturing Cloud-computing Container technology.

Sustainable Manufacturing Digital Twins: A Review of Development and Application,"Sustainable manufacturing as a concept as well as the practices that are deployed are well established in the literature. Tools that guide the development of manufacturing to have less environmental impact are being deployed and documented. The power of digital technology to enable manufacturing systems to be more productive is well established and advances continue to be made. What is less well known is how digital technology can support the pursuit of sustainable manufacturing, especially using digital models, shadows and twins. Here a digital simulation model is configured to analyse, replicate and drive the real production respectively to improve resource productivity in the widest sense. This paper considers the literature and practice of such digital tools in manufacturing operations as well as across the lifecycle. Literature considered is mostly from 2018 onwards as this is the point at which digital twin empirical work emerges. Whilst the work on digital twins is advancing fast, the work on sustainable manufacturing is limited to energy and, to some extent, resource efficiency. Further when compared to documented practice, the academic field appears to be lagging depending on how the loose definition of digital twins in practice is interpreted.

Prior to any real-life change in the system, for CMfg it is important to anticipate and optimize the response of the system through simulation. Digital Twins (DT) is a simulation method for this paradigm that is different from existing simulation methods in two ways. It is a virtual copy of the system containing all the components and can connect to the controller in real time. The goal of this work is to develop a DT for an educational manufacturing cell. The educational manufacturing cell is a FESTO Reconfigurable Mechatronics System (RMS). The cell has four stations that uses pallets to transport the product on the conveyor belt and assembles a part of the product. The Siemens Process Simulate: TECNOMATIX, was used to create the DT of the system. The system is modeled in a CAD program and then imported into TECNOMATIX Process Simulate, where it is programmed to replicate the processes.

Modelling for digital twins—potential role of surrogate models,"The application of white box models in digital twins is often hindered by missing knowl-edge, uncertain information and computational difficulties. Our aim was to overview the difficulties and challenges regarding the modelling aspects of digital twin applications and to explore the fields where surrogate models can be utilised advantageously. In this sense, the paper discusses what types of surrogate models are suitable for different practical problems as well as introduces the appropriate techniques for building and using these models. A number of examples of digital twin applications from both continuous processes and discrete manufacturing are presented to underline the potentials of utilising surrogate models. The surrogate models and model-building methods are categorised according to the area of applications. The importance of keeping these models up to date through their whole model life cycle is also highlighted.

Manufacturing resilience and agility through processes digital twin: Design and testing applied in the LPBF case,"Digital twins can be very promising towards offering agility and resilience in manufacturing. Especially at process level, the adaptability and the real-time optimization they can bring along is highly desired. However, digital twins, being the outcome of severe systems integration are difficult to be designed and be implemented integrating all the desired functions, such as process control and quality assessment. This work investigates the opportunity to integrate different models under the concept of a digital twin of a manufacturing process (namely LPBF) and be able to meet diverse requirements, such as adaptivity, real-time optimization and uncertainty management. The suggested framework takes into account all the phases of the digital twin, such as sensorization, modelling, diagnostic and prognostic functions and puts together an architecture including all available models and thus paving the way towards achieving to meet all the requirements. A case study is also presented showing the capabilities of the partial models utilized as well as the performance of the digital twin in closed-loop control. The digital twin is proved to be highly feasible and appears to have good performance indicators.  © 2021 The Authors.

Digital-twin enabled experimentation testbed for mbse,"As Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) continues to advance in terms of system life cycle coverage, modeling languages, methods, and tools, there is a growing need for an overarching framework to organize MBSE artifacts and facilitate their rapid retrieval and use by MBSE researchers. Also, researchers need a simulation environment that supports exploration, experimentation with different modeling constructs and algorithms, and performance data collection over a broad range of conditions and with different assumptions. To address these requirements, this paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE research testbed for modeling, experimentation, and verification and validation, and exploration of system behaviors over a wide range of operational scenarios and operating conditions. The testbed is intended to help researchers analyze data to uncover patterns and trends, reuse models and components as applicable, and serve as a repository for scenarios, system models, case studies, and lessons learned. Two different operational scenarios from different domains are used to convey the capabilities of the testbed.

Digital twins: Understanding the added value of integrated models for through-life engineering services,"Digital twins are digital representations of physical products or systems that consist of multiple models from various domains describing them on multiple scales. By means of communication, digital twins change and evolve together with their physical counterparts throughout their lifecycle. Domain-specific partial models that make up the digital twin, such as the CAD model or the degradation model, are usually well known and provide accurate descriptions of certain parts of the physical asset. However, in complex systems, the value of integrating the partial models increases because it facilitates the study of their complex behaviours which only emerge from the interactions between various parts of the system. The paper proposes that the partial models of the digital twin share a common model space that integrates them through a definition of their interrelations and acts as a bridge between the digital twin and the physical asset. The approach is illustrated in a case of a mechatronic product - a differential drive mobile robot developed as a testbed for digital twin research. It is demonstrated how the integrated models add value to different stages of the lifecycle, allowing for evaluation of performance in the design stage and real-time reflection with the physical asset during its operation. © 2018 The Authors.

Model-based automatic generation of digital twin models for the simulation of reconfigurable manufacturing systems for timber construction,"Reconfigurable manufacturing systems adapt to changing requirements and therefore offer a solution to the challenges associated with increasing product variety and shorter product life cycles. This is especially helpful in the prefabrication in timber construction, as components and requirements vary widely between projects. However, reconfigurations must be quick to keep downtimes short. The planning of reconfigurations is a complex problem where digital twins and simulation models of the manufacturing systems are necessary for simulation and validation. In our timber prefabrication use case, building components and requirements change from project to project, and the manufacturing system needs to reconfigure frequently. The building components and the configuration of the manufacturing system are designed simultaneously during a co-design process to ensure the integrity of the manufacturing process in a changing manufacturing environment. Hence, this may require many iterations of the planning process. Each iteration needs validation through a simulation. However, the manual generation of simulation models is time-consuming and error-prone and thus poses an obstacle for the digital planning phase. This paper addresses this issue and presents a model-based approach to generate simulation models for reconfigurable manufacturing systems. Our system and its components are modeled in automation markup language as this domain-specific language allows us to model not only kinematics and geometry but also behavior, skills, and interfaces to check the compatibility of components. We apply the method to our use case with the IntCDC wood prefabrication system. The proposed method builds a component graph for a configuration of the manufacturing system and generates the required packages for the simulation in Gazebo and ROS. To build simulation models automatically, we apply model-to-model and model-to-text transformation techniques. The proposed method is suitable for integration in the digital co-design workflow of IntCDC and allows fast iterations with continuous simulations of machine configurations throughout the planning process. © 2022 The Authors.

Evolutionary digital twin model with an agent-based discrete-event simulation method,"A digital twin model provides the ability to adjust candidate behavior based on feedback from its physical part. However, small interactions between different subsystems and using real-time data about physical workshops are the primary problems in digital twin models. The essence of the digital twin model is the combination of the physical simulation method and the data-driven simulation method, and agent-based discrete-event modeling theory is an advanced way to build a digital twin model. Thus, the theoretical framework of the Digital Twin Workshop model is improved from the underlying modeling logic based on this new theory. By combining reinforcement learning with the digital twin workshop model, an evolutionary digital twin workshop model is developed in this study. This model is then applied to a real-world case. A comparison is made between the Digital Twin Workshop model with reinforcement learning policy and a heuristic policy and a random policy.

A five-step approach to planning data-driven digital twins for discrete manufacturing systems,"A digital twin of a manufacturing system is a digital copy of the physical manufacturing system that consists of various digital models at multiple scales and levels. Digital twins that communicate with their physical counterparts throughout their lifecycle are the basis for data-driven factories. The problem with developing digital models that form the digital twin is that they operate with large amounts of heterogeneous data. Since the models represent simplifications of the physical world, managing the heterogeneous data and linking the data with the digital twin represent a challenge. The paper proposes a five-step approach to planning data-driven digital twins of manufacturing systems and their processes. The approach guides the user from breaking down the system and the underlying building blocks of the processes into four groups. The development of a digital model includes predefined necessary parameters that allow a digital model connecting with a real manufacturing system. The connection enables the control of the real manufacturing system and allows the creation of the digital twin. Presentation and visualization of a system functioning based on the digital twin for different participants is presented in the last step. The suitability of the approach for the industrial environment is illustrated using the case study of planning the digital twin for material logistics of the manufacturing system. © 2021 by the authors.

Building Discrete-Event Simulation for Digital Twin Applications in Production Systems,"Digital equivalence is the main objective of Digital Twin (DT)s, and simulation is an integral part. DTs reach beyond traditional simulation with the help of real-time synchronization through Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies. Simulation supports off-line experimentations and planning, while DTs offer synchronous execution and modification. DTs help to understand 'what may happen'. Also, they present 'what is happening' and its management methodologies. In this paper, we present building aspects and an integration approach for a Digital Twin based Discrete-Event Simulation model. Our approach utilizes a data-driven agent-based simulation within a DT framework. It presents an integration layer that provides two essential features: reconfiguration and state initialization. It gives simulation models configurability and integrity that are required for operating within a DT. Our proposed approach is presented through a use case of a semiconductor manufacturing system.

Continuous adaption through real data analysis turn simulation models into digital twins,"Digital twins of production systems enable new forms of production control, flexibility and continuous improvement. While off-the-shelf software for discrete-event simulation permits the fast implementation of rough simulation models with sufficient accuracy for project-based analysis, they lack the precision and generality of a digital twin. This paper presents an approach to close the gap between model and reality by continuous and iterative updates enabled by connecting the simulation model to IT systems and smart data analysis.

Hierarchical Aggregation/Disaggregation for Adaptive Abstraction-Level Conversion in Digital Twin-Based Smart Semiconductor Manufacturing,"In smart manufacturing, engineers typically analyze unexpected real-time problems using digitally cloned discrete-event (DE) models for wafer fabrication. To achieve a faster response to problems, it is essential to increase the speed of DE simulations because making optimal decisions for addressing the issues requires repeated simulations. This paper presents a hierarchical aggregation/disaggregation (A/D) method that substitutes complex event-driven operations with two-layered abstracted models-single-group mean-delay models (SMDMs) and multi-group MDMs (MMDMs)-to gain simulation speedup. The SMDM dynamically abstracts a DE machine group's behaviors into observed mean-delay constants when the group converges into a steady state. The MMDM fast-forwards the input lots by bypassing the chained processing steps in multiple steady-state groups until it schedules the lots for delivery to subsequent unsteady groups after corresponding multi-step mean delays. The key component, the abstraction-level converter (ALC), has the roles of MMDM allocation, deallocation, extension, splitting, and controls the flow of each group's input lot by deciding the destination DE model, SMDM, and MMDMs. To maximize the reuse of previously computed multi-step delays for the dynamically changing MMDMs, we propose an efficient method to manage the delays using two-level caches. Each steady-state group's ALC performs statistical testing to detect the lot-arrival change to reactivate the DE model. However, fast-forwarding (FF) results in incorrect test results of the bypassed group's ALCs due to the missed observations of the bypassed lots. Thus, we propose a method for test-sample reinitialization that considers the bypassing. Moreover, since a bypassed group's unexpected divergence can change the multi-step delays of previously scheduled events, a method for examination of FF history is designed to trace the highly influenced events. This proposed method has been applied in various case studies, and it has achieved speedups of up to about 5.9 times, with 2.5 to 8.3% degradation in accuracy.  © 2013 IEEE.",2021,Cloning Digital twin Semiconductor device manufacture Hierarchical aggregation Missed observations Multiple steady state Real-time problems Semiconductor manufacturing Simulation speed-up Smart manufacturing Statistical testing Discrete event simulationAbstraction-level conversion aggregation/disaggregation discrete-event modeling smart manufacturing wafer fabrication,academic,"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 639798, Singapore; School of Electronics Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, South Korea",233,0.23529411764705882
Developing digital twins for production enterprises,"This article presents a new approach to developing digital twins of production companies with the use of simulation methods. It describes the concept of digital twins as an integrated system that aggregates simulation models, databases and intelligent software modules of the class of genetic optimization algorithms, subsystems of data mining, etc. The article presents examples of simulation models of different production companies, in particular, a typical assembly plant and a typical oil production enterprise. The first company carries out activities to assembly products from individual components with its own individual characteristics. To describe the behavior of such an enterprise, methods of agent and discrete-event modeling are used. The second enterprise produces raw carbohydrate materials at existing fields with individual characteristics. The integrated simulation models thus developed are integrated with a subject-oriented database and optimization modules that facilitate providing a control of the technological and resource characteristics of the respective production enterprises.

A Simulation Based Approach to Digital Twin’s Interoperability Verification & Validation,"The digital twins of production systems are one of the pillars of the Indus-try of the Future. Despite numerous on-going research and development initiatives the verification and validation of the digital twin remains a major scientific obstacle. This work proposes a simulation-based approach to achieve this goal: support Digital Twin verification and validation through the definition of a dedicated framework. A simulation model is used in place of the real-world system for ensuring the digital twin behaves as expected and for assessing its proper interoperability with the system to be twinned with. Then the simulation model is replaced by the real-world sys-tem, to interoperate with the verified and validated digital twin. With such an approach, the interoperability middleware, i.e. the IoT between the sys-tem and its digital twin can also be modeled, simulated, verified and vali-dated.

A Digital Twin-Based Automatic Programming Method for Adaptive Control of Manufacturing Cells,"The booming personalized and customized demands of customers in Industry 4.0 pose a great challenge for manufacturing enterprises in terms of flexibility and responsiveness. Nowadays, many effective dynamic scheduling approaches have been proposed for manufacturing systems to quickly respond to changes in customer demands, where, however, the implementation of an automatic programming method with high control accuracy and low control delay is still challenging. The above unaddressed issue brings about a lot of labor-intensive and time-consuming manual offline programming work when adjusting the scheduling scheme to meet dynamic customer demands, resulting in limited flexibility and responsiveness in current manufacturing systems. To bridge this gap, a bi-level adaptive control architecture enabled by an automatic programming method is proposed and embedded into a digital twin manufacturing cell (DTMC). The bi-level architecture aims to automatically map an input task scheduling scheme with a batch of jobs into a group of control programs through a behavior model network and a set of event models embedded in DTMC. It also provides an adaptive program modification mechanism to quickly adapt to the dynamic adjustment of the scheduling scheme caused by the changing of customer demands or production conditions, thus equipping DTMC with strong flexibility and responsiveness. Based on the bi-level architecture, a DTMC prototype system is developed, where its application and evaluation examples demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2013 IEEE.",2022,Behavioral research Flexible manufacturing systems Industry 4.0 Job shop scheduling Memory architecture Network architecture Sales Software prototyping Adaptation models Adaptive Control Aerospace electronics Behaviour models Customer demands Dynamic scheduling Event model Job-Shop scheduling Manufacturing Adaptive control systemsadaptive control automatic programming behavior model Digital twin event model industry 4.0,academic,"School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'An Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China; State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'An Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China",284,0.25
Digital twin application with horizontal coordination for reinforcement-learning-based production control in a re-entrant job shop,"In a re-entrant job shop (RJS), an entity can visit the same resource type multiple times; this is called re-entrancy, which occurs frequently in actual industries. Re-entrancy causes an NP-hard problem and is dominated by heuristics-based production control. The stochastic arrivals due to re-entrancy require the design of an appropriate dispatching rule. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an efficient technique for establishing robust dispatching rules; however, only a few cases that coordinate RL-based production control with a digital twin (DT) have been reported. This study proposes a novel production control model that applies a DT and horizontal coordination with RL-based production control. The requirements for dispatching in the RJS and coordination between RL and the DT were defined. A suitable architectural framework, service composition, and systematic logic library schema were developed to exploit the advanced characteristics of the DT and improve the existing production control methods. This study is an early case of coordinating RL and DT, and the findings revealed that RL policy networks should be imported in the creation procedures rather than being synchronised to the DT. The results should be a valuable reference for research on other types of RL-based production control with regard to horizontal coordination. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,Digital twin E-learning NP-hard Production control Reinforcement learning Stochastic systems Architectural frameworks Dispatching rules Job shop Policy networks Production control model Service compositions Stochastic arrivals Job shop schedulingAsset administration shell digital twin production control re-entrant job shop reinforcement learning,academic,"Department of Industrial Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon-si, South Korea; Digital Factory Solution R&D Center, MICUBE Solution Inc., Seoul, South Korea",284,0.23076923076923078
Smart digital twin for ZDM-based job-shop scheduling,"The growing digitization of manufacturing processes is revolutionizing the production job-shop by leading it toward the Smart Manufacturing (SM) paradigm. For a process to be smart, it is necessary to combine a given blend of data technologies, information and knowledge that enable it to perceive its environment and to autonomously perform actions that maximize its success possibilities in its assigned tasks. Of all the different ways leading to this transformation, both the generation of virtual replicas of processes and applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide a wide range of possibilities whose exploration is today a far from negligible sources of opportunities to increase industrial companies' competitiveness. As a complex manufacturing process, production order scheduling in the job-shop is a necessary scenario to act by implementing these technologies. This research work considers an initial conceptual smart digital twin (SDT) framework for scheduling job-shop orders in a zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) environment. The SDT virtually replicates the job-shop scheduling issue to simulate it and, based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology, trains a prescriber agent and a process monitor.

Dynamic production scheduling of digital twin job-shop based on edge computing,"The current production scheduling models cannot effectively enable the real-time interaction between information space and physical space. To dynamically schedule twin digital job-shop, this paper attempts to realize the dynamic scheduling of digital twin job-shop (DTJ) based on edge computing. First, the architecture of the DTJ was established by adding the digital twin between the business management layer and the operation execution layer of the traditional job-shop. On this basis, the DTJ was fully modelled, and the manufacturing process was monitored, analyzed and managed remoted by edge computing. To realize dynamic scheduling, a DTJ scheduling model was established through data mining. The model consists of two parts: a data collection model and a multi-scheduling knowledge model.

Job Shop Scheduling Based on Digital Twin Technology: A Survey and an Intelligent Platform,"The concept of digital twinning has become a hot topic in the manufacturing industry in recent years. The emerging digital twin technology is an intelligent technology that makes full use of multimodels, big data, and interdisciplinary knowledge, which provides some new approaches for the field of the intelligent manufacturing industry. The job shop scheduling problem has been an important research field in the discrete manufacturing industry. Digital twin technology is adopted to solve the problem of job shop scheduling, which provides the possibility for the intelligent development of workshops. Based on digital twin technology and combined with the actual problem of production line scheduling, we propose a new intelligent scheduling platform to solve the shop scheduling problems above. Meanwhile, based on the prediction and diagnosis of multisource dynamic interference in the workshop production process by big data analysis technology, the corresponding interference strategy is formulated in advance by the scheduling cloud platform.

Digital twin based optimization of a manufacturing execution system to handle high degrees of customer specifications,"Lean production principles have greatly contributed to the efficient and customer-oriented mass production of goods and services. A core element of lean production is the focus on cycle times and designing production controls and buffers around any bottlenecks in the system. Hence, a production line organized by lean principles will operate in a static or at least quasi-static way. While the individualization of products is an interesting business approach, it can influence cycle times and in-time production. This work demonstrates how performance losses induced by highly variable cycle times can be recovered using a digital twin. The unit under analysis is an industrial joiner’s workshop. Due to the high variance in cycle time, the joinery fails its production target, even if all machines are below 80% usage. Using a discrete event simulation of the production line, different production strategies can be evaluated efficiently and systematically. It is successfully shown that the performance losses due to the highly variable cycle times can be compensated using a digital twin in combination with optimization strategies. This is achieved by operating the system in a non-static mode, exploiting the flexibilities within the systems. © 2020 by the authors.

Analysis of a closed-loop digital twin using discrete event simulation,"Given recent advancements in technology and recognizing the evolution of smart manufacturing, the implementation of digital twins for factories and processes is becoming more common and more useful. Additionally, expansion in connectivity, growth in data storage, and the implementation of the industrial internet of things (IIoT) allow for greater opportunities not only with digital twins but with closed loop analytics. Discrete event simulation (DES) has been used to create digital twins and, in some instances, fitted with live connections to closely monitor factory operations. However, the benefits of a connected digital twin are not easily quantified. Therefore, a test bed demonstration factory was used, which implements smart technologies, to evaluate the effectiveness of a closed-loop digital twin in identifying and reacting to trends in production. This involves a digital twin of a factory process using DES. Although traditional DES is typically modeled using historical data, a DES system was developed which made use of live data to improve predictions. This model had live data updated directly to the DES model without user interaction, creating an adaptive and dynamic model. It was found that this DES with live data typically provided more accurate predictions of future performance and unforeseen near future problems when compared to the predictions of a traditional DES using only historic data, resulting in smarter decisions and implementation of more timely solutions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2022,Digital storage Flow control Forecasting Manufacture Closed-loop Closed-loop process Data storage Discrete-event simulations Loop process Real-time factory Real-time factory analytic Smart manufacturing Smart technology Test bed demonstrations Discrete event simulationClosed-loop processes Digital twin Discrete event simulation Real-time factory analytics Smart manufacturing,academic,"Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, United States; Northrop Grumman, Promontory, UT, United States; University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, United States",302,0.3170731707317073
"Past, present, and future research of digital twin for smart manufacturing","In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, there is a growing focus on digital twin (DT) in order to advance toward smart manufacturing. Thus, researchers have conducted numerous studies on DT and extensively developed related technologies.

A framework for data-driven digital twins for smart manufacturing,"Adoption of digital twins in smart factories, that model real statuses of manufacturing systems through simulation with real time actualization, are manifested in the form of increased productivity, as well as reduction in costs and energy consumption. The sharp increase in changing customer demands has resulted in factories transitioning rapidly and yielding shorter product life cycles. Traditional modeling and simulation approaches are not suited to handle such scenarios. As a possible solution, we propose a generic data-driven framework for automated generation of simulation models as basis for digital twins for smart factories. The novelty of our proposed framework is in the data-driven approach that exploits advancements in machine learning and process mining techniques, as well as continuous model improvement and validation. The goal of the framework is to minimize and fully define, or even eliminate, the need for expert knowledge in the extraction of the corresponding simulation models.

Automated Model Transformation in modeling Digital Twins of Industrial Internet-of-Things Applications utilizing AutomationML,"In recent years, the manufacturing industry sector has undergone major changes. Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks. As this leads to a strong increase regarding complexity, engineering such current or future manufacturing systems becomes a difficult task. An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach transforming the logical architecture of a system into its technical implementation by utilizing AutomationML. As the goal is to perform this step automatically, additional tool support is provided by developing specific software. The results of this approach are thereby evaluated by a real-world case study, which is applied according to the concepts of the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). © 2021 IEEE.",2021,Internet of things Manufacture Network architecture Software design Systems engineering Architecture modeling Automated model transformations AutomationML Industrial internet of thing Model driven architectures Model-based system engineering Model-based system engineerings Model-driven architecture Reference architecture Reference architecture model industrie 4.0 Software architectureAutomationML Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) Model-driven Architecture (MDA) Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0),academic,"Josef Ressel Center For Dependable System-of-Systems Engineering, Urstein Sued 1, Puch/Salzburg, A-5412, Austria; Siemens Technology, Otto-Hahn-Ring 6, Munich, 81739, Germany; Siemens Technology, Guenther-Scharowsky-Str. 1, Erlangen, 91058, Germany; Otto-v.-Guericke University, Universitatsplatz 2, Magdeburg, D-39106, Germany",308,0.23728813559322035
Unifying digital twin framework: Simulation-based proof-of-concept,"In recent years, the Digital Twin (DT) concept has surfaced in many areas and landed the approach in top strategic technology trends. However, there seems to be no unique understanding of the concept, and debates about what is a DT are leading to ambiguity on the concrete solution to be developed in a given situation. This paper introduces a unifying reference framework, to both serve as a conceptual basis that disambiguates the concept and a guide to derive custom solutions. It is a technology-agnostic three-layered model, which reconciles existing understandings of DT under a common umbrella. We also derive an operational architecture as a possible implementation of the framework, which we demonstrate on two use cases. The large adoption of such a framework will draw a clear line between what is a DT and what is not, while establishing a high-level standard model for DT engineering. © 2021 The Authors.

Explainable Modeling in Digital Twin,"Stakeholders' participation in the modeling process is important to successful Digital Twin (DT) implementation. The key question in the modeling process is to decide which options to include. Explaining the key question clearly ensures the organizations and end-users know what the digital models in DT are capable of. To support successful DT implementation, we propose a framework of explainable modeling to enable the collaboration and interaction between modelers and stakeholders. We formulate the modeling process mathematically and develop three types of automatically generated explanations to support understanding and build trust. We introduce three explainability scores to measure the value of explainable modeling. We illustrate how the proposed explainable modeling works by a case study on developing and implementing a DT factory. The explainable modeling increases communication efficiency and builds trust by clearly expressing the model competencies, answering key questions in modeling automatically, and enabling consistent understanding of the model.  © 2021 IEEE.",2021,Automatically generated Case-studies Communication efficiency Digital modeling End-users Modeling process Stakeholder participation,academic,"Tsinghua University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Beijing, 100084, China; University of California, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Berkeley, 94720, CA, United States",316,0.3333333333333333
Using automationml and graph-based design languages for automatic generation of digital twins of cyber-physical systems,"The interdisciplinary development of smart factories and cyber-physical systems CPS shows the weaknesses of classical development methods. For example, the communication of the interdisciplinary participants in the development process of CPS is difficult due to a lack of cross-domain language comprehension. At the same time, the functional complexity of the systems to be developed increases and they act operationally as independent CPSs. And it is not only the product that needs to be developed, but also the manufacturing processes are complex. The use of graph-based design languages offers a technical solution to these challenges. The UML-based structures offer a cross-domain language understanding for all those involved in the interdisciplinary development process. Simulations are required for the rapid and successful development of new products. Depending on the functional scope, graphical simulations of the production equipment are used to simulate the manufacturing processes as a digital factory or a virtual commissioning simulation. Due to the high number of functional changes during the development process, it makes sense to automatically generate the simulation modelling as digital twins of the products or means of production from the graph-based design languages. The paper describes how digital twins are automatically generated using AutomationML according to the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) or the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA). © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.",2020,Computer simulation languages Cyber Physical System Embedded systems Graphic methods Manufacture Modeling languages Product design Automatic Generation Automatically generated Functional complexity Manufacturing process Means of productions Production equipments Reference architecture Virtual commissioning Digital twinAutomationML Crossdomain Engineering Digital Twin Graph-based Design Languages RAMI 4.0,academic,"Albstadt-Sigmaringen University, Albstadt, Germany; CMC-Kiesel GmbH, Hechingen, Germany",316,0.2558139534883721
Towards developing multiscale-multiphysics models and their surrogates for digital twins of metal additive manufacturing,"Artificial intelligence (AI) embedded within digital models of manufacturing processes can be used to improve process productivity and product quality significantly. The application of such advanced capabilities particularly to highly digitalized processes such as metal additive manufacturing (AM) is likely to make those processes commercially more attractive. AI capabilities will reside within Digital Twins (DTs) which are living virtual replicas of the physical processes. DTs will be empowered to operate autonomously in a diagnostic control capacity to supervise processes and can be interrogated by the practitioner to inform the optimal processing route for any given product. The utility of the information gained from the DTs would depend on the quality of the digital models and, more importantly, their faster-solving surrogates which dwell within DTs for consultation during rapid decision-making. In this article, we point out the exceptional value of DTs in AM and focus on the need to create high-fidelity multiscale-multiphysics models for AM processes to feed the AI capabilities. We identify technical hurdles for their development, including those arising from the multiscale and multiphysics characteristics of the models, the difficulties in linking models of the subprocesses across scales and physics, and the scarcity of experimental data. We discuss the need for creating surrogate models using machine learning approaches for real-time problem-solving. We further identify non-technical barriers, such as the need for standardization and difficulties in collaborating across different types of institutions. We offer potential solutions for all these challenges, after reflecting on and researching discussions held at an international symposium on the subject in 2019. We argue that a collaborative approach can not only help accelerate their development compared with disparate efforts, but also enhance the quality of the models by allowing modular development and linkages that account for interactions between the various sub-processes in AM. A high-level roadmap is suggested for starting such a collaboration. © 2021 The Authors",2021,Additives Decision making Industry 4.0 Machine learning Problem solving Digital modeling Machine-learning Manufacturing IS Manufacturing process Metal additives Multi-physics modeling Multiscale models Process productivity Process products Products quality 3D printersAdditive manufacturing Artificial intelligence Digital twins Industry 4.0 Machine learning Multiphysics modeling Multiscale modeling,academic,"CSIRO Manufacturing, Private Bag 10, Clayton, 3169, VIC, Australia; CSIRO Manufacturing, PO Box 218, Lindfield, 2070, NSW, Australia; School of Computing, Australian National University, Acton, 2601, ACT, Australia; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, 16802, PA, United States; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 7000 East Avenue, Livermore, 94550, CA, United States; Ira A.

Robust additive manufacturing performance through a control oriented digital twin,"The additive manufacturing process control utilizing digital twins is an emerging issue. However, robustness in process performance is still an open aspect, due to uncertainties, e.g., in material properties. To this end, in this work, a digital twin offering uncertainty management and robust process control is designed and implemented. As a process control design method, the Linear Matrix Inequalities are adopted. Within specific uncertainty limits, the performance of the process is proven to be acceptably constant, thus achieving robust additive manufacturing. Variations of the control law are also investigated, in order for the applicability of the control to be demonstrated in different machine architectures. The comparison of proposed controllers is done against a fine-tuned conventional proportional–integral–derivative (PID) and the initial open-loop model for metals manufacturing. As expected, the robust control design achieved a 68% faster response in the settling time metric, while a well-calibrated PID only achieved 38% compared to the initial model. © 2021 by the authors.

Building a digital twin for additive manufacturing through the exploitation of blockchain: A case analysis of the aircraft industry,"Blockchain is becoming a widespread digital technology that allows every transaction to be tracked in an inviolable way, hence making it possible to go back through the entire history of products and product components. Its idiosyncratic characteristics can be especially useful in the aircraft industry, a highly technologically-based sector, wherein manufacturers of components are governed by stringent technical standards, the aim of which is to certify and monitor the whole component production process. In addition, the sector makes significant use of additive manufacturing technologies to perform the rapid prototyping of product components, realized through the supply chain, hence reducing time-to-market, while ensuring quality and containing costs. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses on the phases characterizing the metal additive manufacturing process, in which a component for the aircraft industry can be produced and proposes a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry through the exploitation of Blockchain solutions.

A digital twin-enhanced system for engineering product family design and optimization,"Engineering product family design and optimization in complex environments has been a major bottleneck in today's industrial transformation towards smart manufacturing. Digital twin (DT), as a core part of cyber-physical system (CPS), can provide decision support to enhance engineering product lifecycle management workflows via remote monitoring and control, high-fidelity simulation, and solution generation functionalities. Although many studies have proven DT to be highly suited for industry needs, little has been reported on the product family design and optimization capabilities specifically with context awareness, which could be leaving many enterprises ambivalent on its adoption. To fill this gap, a reusable and transparent DT capable of situational recognition and self-correction is essentially required. This paper develops a generic DT architecture reference model to enable the context-aware product family design optimization process in a cost-effective manner. A case study featuring asset re-/configuration within a dynamic environment is further described to demonstrate its in-context decision-aiding capabilities.
