Additionally, expansion in connectivity, growth in data storage, and the implementation of the industrial internet of things (IIoT) allow for greater opportunities not only with digital twins but with closed loop analytics. Discrete event simulation (DES) has been used to create digital twins and, in some instances, fitted with live connections to closely monitor factory operations. However, the benefits of a connected digital twin are not easily quantified. Therefore, a test bed demonstration factory was used, which implements smart technologies, to evaluate the effectiveness of a closed-loop digital twin in identifying and reacting to trends in production. This involves a digital twin of a factory process using DES. Although traditional DES is typically modeled using historical data, a DES system was developed which made use of live data to improve predictions. This model had live data updated directly to the DES model without user interaction, creating an adaptive and dynamic model. It was found that this DES with live data typically provided more accurate predictions of future performance and unforeseen near future problems when compared to the predictions of a traditional DES using only historic data, resulting in smarter decisions and implementation of more timely solutions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Closed-loop processes; Digital twin; Discrete event simulation; Real-time factory analytics; Smart manufacturing","Digital storage; Flow control; Forecasting; Manufacture; Closed-loop; Closed-loop process; Data storage; Discrete-event simulations; Loop process; Real-time factory; Real-time factory analytic; Smart manufacturing; Smart technology; Test bed demonstrations; Discrete event simulation",Article,Scopus

In many industrial contexts, the collection of real-time data from the system is a costly task and the performance predicted by digital twins may be affected by input uncertainty, due to the scarcity of data used to input simulation parameters, thus leading stakeholders to biased decision-making. Literature approaches treat this problem mainly from a theoretical point of view and are applied on very simple systems that do not adequately represent real factories. The aim of this paper is to explore the advantages and drawbacks of an input uncertainty simulation technique, namely the metamodel-assisted bootstrapping procedure. This technique is applied and extended to evaluate the production rate of a lab-scale manufacturing system. We show it is possible, despite the scarcity of data, to build a reliable confidence interval on the production rate and to identify those parameters whose effect on the performance is most relevant. Moreover, the marginal contribution of each input parameter to the performance can be quantitatively assessed, thus enabling stakeholders to identify which parameters to focus on in data collection activity. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

This enables more realistic and accurate modelling of stochastic behaviour.

Conventional oil and gas reserves are finite and are being depleted at a relatively rapid pace. With alternative fuels and technologies still unable to fill the gap, research and development of unconventional petroleum resources have accelerated markedly in the past 20 years. With some of the largest bitumen deposits in the world, Canada has an active oil mining and refining industry. Bitumen deposits, also called oil sands, are formed in complex geological environments and subject to a host of syn-and post-depositional processes. As a result, some ores are heterogeneous, at both individual reservoir and regional scales, which poses significant problems in terms of extractive processing. Moreover, with increased environmental awareness and enhanced governmental regulations and industry best practices, it is critical for oil sands producers to improve process efficiencies across the spectrum. Discrete event simulation (DES) is a computational paradigm to develop dynamic digital twins, including the interactions of critical variables and processes. In the case of mining systems, the digital twin includes aspects of geological uncertainty. The resulting simulations include alternate operational modes that are characterized by separate operational policies and tactics. The current DES framework has been customized to integrate predictive modelling data, generated via partial least squares (PLS) regression, in order to evaluate system-wide response to geological uncertainty. Sample computations that are based on data from Canada’s oil sands are presented, showing the framework to be a powerful tool to assess and attenuate operational risk factors in the extractive processing of bitumen deposits.

Also, they present 'what is happening' and its management methodologies.

Our approach utilizes a data-driven agent-based simulation within a DT framework. It presents an integration layer that provides two essential features: reconfiguration and state initialization.

Automated simulation model generation techniques can significantly reduce model development phases and allow for using simulation models for short term decisions in production. Application studies and test cases are scarce in the literature. In this paper, we present the application of a digital model generation method.

As for a complex discrete manufacturing system (DMS), it is a digital model for emulating or reproducing the functions or actions of a real manufacturing system by giving the system simulation information or directly driven by a real system with proper connections between the DT model and the real-world system. It is a key building block for smart factory and manufacturing under the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The key research question is how to effectively create a DT model during the design stage of a complex manufacturing system and to make it usable throughout the system's lifecycle such as the production stage. Given that there are some existing discussions on DT framework development, this paper focuses on the modeling methods for rapidly creating a virtual model and the connection implementation mechanism between a physical world production system at a workshop level and its mirrored virtual model. To reach above goals, in this paper, the discrete event system (DES) modeling theory is applied to the three-dimension DT model. First, for formally representing a manufacturing system and creating its virtual model, seven basic elements: controller, executor, processor, buffer, flowing entity, virtual service node and logistics path of a DMS have been identified and the concept of the logistics path network and the service cell is introduced to uniformly describe a manufacturing system. Second, for implementing interconnection and interaction, a new interconnection and data interaction mechanism between the physical system and its virtual model for through-life applications has been designed. With them, each service cell consists of seven elements and encapsulates input/output information and control logic. All the discrete cells are constructed and mapped onto different production-process-oriented digital manufacturing modules by integrating logical, geometric and data models. As a result, the virtual-physical connection is realized to form a DT model. The proposed virtual modeling method and the associated connection mechanism have been applied to a real-world workshop DT to demonstrate its practicality and usefulness. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers","Cyber-physical system; Digital twin; Discrete event system modeling theory; Virtual-physical connection","Complex networks; Digital twin; Industrial research; Life cycle; Manufacture; Complex manufacturing systems; Digital manufacturing; Discrete manufacturing systems; Framework development; Implementation mechanisms; Physical connections; Research questions; System simulations; Discrete event simulation",Article,Scopus

With the advent of CAD/CAE/CAM Softwares and high power computers, facility layout can be planned and engineered from a remote location. Manufacturing facilities undergo a lot of changes due to change in customer requirements, government regulations, safety standards, the complexity of products and process improvisation. It becomes indispensable to keep manufacturing facility digitally updated for upfront simulations and to capture facility change requirements caused by product variations. In the current methodology, it takes a significant amount of time and cost to keep manufacturing facility digitally updated. Digital Twin is an emerging technology that nowadays almost all consumer goods, airplanes, manufacturing plants, oil refineries, transportation networks, and even entire cities are having the potential to have Digital Twin of its own.

Tags attached to each physical asset sends a signal to the receiver when asset movement or orientation occurs at the physical facility, Tags attached to each asset sends a signal to the receiver. The receiver sends pre-processed information to a gateway which acts as an edge device to process and converts those signals as transformation matric which gets synced to PLM system.

Designing, planning, improving and controlling this system can be very challenging due to the system complexity governed by several subjective factors that affect the hospital interrelated functions or services. However, continuously changing health care needs that consistently face hospitals require them to keep continuously improving the efficiency of these services as demand increases and as new services are added. This paper proposes a new methodology that uses the concept of Digital Twin (DT) of hospital services based on Discrete Event Simulation (DES) integrated with health care information systems and Internet of things (IoT) devices. It develops a predictive decision support model that employs real-time services data drawn from these systems and devices. This model enables assessing the efficiency of existing health care delivery systems and evaluating the impact of changes in services without disrupting daily activities of the hospital. The developed model, a digital twin (or a virtual replica of the hospital), simulates a number of key hospital health delivery services, based on relevant data retrieved in real-time. Although the model simulates four key services, initially as a proof of concept, but it proposes a general framework, which can be expanded to include other services. The demonstrated proof-of-concept shows that it achieves better planning and improvement of usage of resources, and thus enabling both practitioners and management to examine any model changes to foresee the effectiveness or efficiency of services before they are applied in reality. © 2018 IEEE.","DES; Digital Twin; Hospital Services; IOT; Pervasive Computing","Decision support systems; Digital devices; Digital integrated circuits; Discrete event simulation; Efficiency; Health care; Hospitals; Information services; Internet of things; Medical computing; Ubiquitous computing; Decision support models; Digital Twin; Health care information system; Hospital service; Human interactions; Impact of changes; Internet of Things (IOT); Real time service; Real time systems",Conference Paper,Scopus
