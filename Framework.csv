This paper proposes an open architecture production line (OAPL) design together with a digital twins-based flexible operating approach for individualized manufacturing. Firstly, an OAPL is designed and implemented with physical reconfigurability by orchestrating different open architectural platforms together with open architecture machine tools (OAMTs). Secondly, an open architectural style modeling and configuration method is presented to enable the software reconfigurability of the controls of the OAPL. Thirdly, a digital twin-based online process emulating and multi-physics simulation is integrated to aid the comprehensive characterizing of the operation status of the OAPL. Based on the system reconfigurability and digital twins system, a triple-layer Learning-Optimization-Reacting approach together with an ensemble algorithm for flexible operating of the OAPL is proposed. The digital twins are formed with the ability to flexibly operate the OAPL for catering to different individualized requirements.

This paper presents a systematic literature review of 98 research papers on various digital supply chain twin dimensions with sustainable performance objectives. The selected papers were reviewed and classified into three broad categories: components of the digital twin, applications in the manufacturing supply chain, and sustainability. Based on the review and future perspectives from the study, we suggest that advancements in technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, and blockchain have increased the potential of digital twin applications in the supply chain. The results indicate that a digital supply chain twin should include the things and humans from the entire supply chain and not be restricted to the local manufacturing systems.

The condition of the manufacturing equipment may in fact lead to schedule unfeasibility or inefficiency, thus requiring responsiveness to preserve productivity and reduce the operational costs. In order to address current limitations of traditional scheduling methods, this work proposes a new framework that exploits the aggregation of several digital twins, representing different physical assets and their autonomous decision-making, together with a global digital twin, in order to perform production scheduling optimization when it is needed. The decision-making process is supported on a fuzzy inference system using the state or conditions of different assets and the production rate of the whole system. The condition of the assets is predicted by the condition-based monitoring modules in the local digital twins of the workstations, whereas the production rate is evaluated and assured by the global digital twin of the shop floor. This paper presents a framework for decentralized and integrated decision-making for re-scheduling of a cyber-physical production system, and the validation and proof-of-concept of the proposed method in an Industry 4.0 pilot line of assembly process.

Production control in petrochemical industry involves complex circumstances and a high demand for timeliness; therefore, agile and smart controls are important components of intelligent manufacturing in the petrochemical industry. This paper proposes a framework and approaches for constructing a digital twin based on the petrochemical industrial IoT, machine learning and a practice loop for information exchange between the physical factory and a virtual digital twin model to realize production control optimization. Unlike traditional production control approaches, this novel approach integrates machine learning and real-time industrial big data to train and optimize digital twin models. It can support petrochemical and other process manufacturing industries to dynamically adapt to the changing environment, respond in a timely manner to changes in the market due to production optimization, and improve economic benefits. Accounting for environmental characteristics, this paper provides concrete solutions for machine learning difficulties in the petrochemical industry, e.g., high data dimensions, time lags and alignment between time series data, and high demand for immediacy. The approaches were evaluated by applying them in the production unit of a petrochemical factory, and a model was trained via industrial IoT data and used to realize intelligent production control based on real-time data. A case study shows the effectiveness of this approach in the petrochemical industry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","digital twin; internet of things; machine learning; petrochemical industry; production control optimization","Data mining; E-learning; Engineering education; Internet of things; Learning systems; Machine learning; Manufacture; Metadata; Petrochemical plants; Production control; Control optimization; digital twin; Environmental characteristic; Intelligent Manufacturing; Intelligent production control; Machine learning technology; Petrochemical industry; Process manufacturing industries; Petrochemicals",Article,Scopus

Accordingly, various architectures for the realization of Digital Twin use cases are conceptualized. There lacks, however, a clear, encompassing architecture covering necessary components of a Digital Twin to realize various use cases in an intelligent automation system. In this contribution, the added value of a Digital Twin in an intelligent automation system is highlighted and various existing definitions and architectures of the Digital Twin are discussed. Flowingly, an architecture for a Digital Twin and an architecture for an Intelligent Digital Twin and their required components are proposed, with which use cases such as plug and produce, self-x and predictive maintenance are enabled. In the opinion of the authors, a Digital Twin requires three main characteristics: Synchronization with the real asset, active data acquisition from the real environment and the ability of simulation. In addition to all the characteristics of a Digital Twin, an Intelligent Digital Twin must also include the characteristics of Artificial Intelligence. The Intelligent Digital Twin can be used for the realization of the autonomous Cyber-Physical Production Systems. In order to realize the proposed architecture for a Digital Twin, several methods, namely the Anchor-Point-Method, a method for heterogeneous data acquisition and data integration as well as an agent-based method for the development of a co-simulation between Digital Twins were implemented and evaluated. © 2019 Ashtari Talkhestani et al., published by De Gruyter.","Architecture of Digital Twin; Artificial Intelligence; Cyber-Physical Production System; Intelligent Digital Twin",,Article,Scopus

To provide an insight into intelligent manufacturing, this paper takes autonomous manufacturing cell as implementation scenario and proposes a data- and knowledge-driven framework for digital twin manufacturing cell (DTMC), which could support autonomous manufacturing by an intelligent perceiving, simulating, understanding, predicting, optimizing and controlling strategy. In addition, three key enabling technologies including digital twin model, dynamic knowledge bases and knowledge-based intelligent skills for supporting the above strategy are analyzed. Then, the implementing methods of DTMC are introduced through a thus constructed digital twin robot, and the usage of data and knowledge for supporting the automous operations of DTMC is also discussed. Finally, benefits of DTMC in smart product-service systems (PSS) and its current challenges are summarized. © 2019 The Authors.
