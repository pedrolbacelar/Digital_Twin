A consistency evaluation method for digital twin models,"Digital twin has shown its great application values in various fields in the past few years, especially manufacturing. During the process of digital twin implementation, the digital twin model is one of the most important foundations. Because the effectiveness and accuracy of digital twin models could directly affect the quality of related services. Nowadays, some efforts have been made on digital twin modeling methods, e.g. multi-disciplinary modeling method, multi-dimension modeling method, and multi-scale modeling method. Besides, the research on Industrial Internet of Things makes it possible to realize the synchronization between digital twin models and the corresponding physical objects. However, the attention on how to conduct a comprehensive consistency evaluation between the models and corresponding physical objects is not enough. Against the background, this paper proposed a consistency evaluation framework towards digital twin shop-floor (DTS) models. The consistency evaluation method mainly contains two phases, i.e. before and after model assembly and model fusion. Before model assembly and model fusion, the geometry models, physics models, behavior models, and rule models are mainly considered. After model assembly and fusion, the overall performance of assembled models and fusion models is paid more attention. Furthermore, the analytic hierarchy process(AHP) is used to form a comprehensive consistency evaluation result for DTS models. At last, a specific application scenario in complex product AIT (Assembly, Integration and Test) shop-floor is given to explain how to apply the proposed framework and method. © 2022 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2022,Analytic hierarchy process Assembly Floors Consistency Evaluation methods Model assembly Model fusion Model method Model validation Model verification Multi-disciplinary modeling Physical objects Shopfloors Industrial researchConsistency Digital twin Model validation Model verification Shop-floor,academic,"School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100083, China; Shenyuan Hornors College, Beihang University, Beijing, 100083, China; Digital Twin International Research Center, International Research Institute for Multidisciplinary Science, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China",7,0.3125

A multi-scale modeling method for digital twin shop-floor,"Digital twin has attracted more and more attentions in the past few years. To put digital twin into practice, modeling is one of the most important foundations. Under this background, some modeling research on digital twin shop-floor which is regarded as the basic unit for realizing smart manufacturing has been carried out. However, current research pays scant attention to the multi-scale features of shop-floor, which hinders the effective application of digital twin shop-floor. As for the problem about how to realize the model construction from the perspective of time-scale and space-scale, this paper firstly proposed a multi-layer modeling framework for supporting model construction from unit layer to system layer to system of system layer. Moreover, the mechanism of model changes over time is also considered. Then, the specific procedures and methods of model assembly, model fusion and model update towards machines and shop-floor are discussed respectively. Finally, a satellite AIT(Assembly, Integration and Test) shop-floor is chosen as the case to validate the correctness and feasibility of proposed framework, procedures and methods. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2022,Floors Digital twin shop-floor Model assembly Model construction Model fusion Model method Model updates Modeling Multiscale modeling Shopfloors System layer Industrial researchDigital twin Digital twin shop-floor Model assembly Model fusion Model update Modeling,academic,"School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China; Shenyuan Hornors College, Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China; Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, Hong Kong",7,0.36363636363636365
Multidimensional data modeling and model validation for digital twin workshop,"Digital twin workshop (DTW) is an important embodiment of intelligent manufacturing in the workshop level, which enables the smart production control and management of the workshop. However, there still exist problems including data modeling and verification of digital model in the process of DTW construction. To solve these problem, multidimensional data modeling and model validation methods of DTW are proposed in this article. First, five-order tensor models for representing manufacturing elements are established to unify the data from physical workshop (PW) and virtual workshop (VW). Then, the mathematical method for verifying DTW twin model is proposed from the recessive and explicit perspective. Finally, a case study of an aerospace machining workshop is carried out to verify the operability and effectiveness of the proposed method. The case analysis shows that the proposed methods can effectively evaluate whether the twin model accurately provides the description of the actual behavior process of physical workshop, and the proposed methods have good performance. © 2021 by ASTM International.",2021,Digital twin Information analysis Production control Behavior process Control and management Intelligent Manufacturing Mathematical method Model validation Modeling and verifications Multidimensional data modeling Virtual workshops Manufacture,academic,"College of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, 210016, China; China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, Beijing, 100076, China",7,0.2692307692307692
Theory of digital twin modeling and its application; [数字孪生模型构建理论及应用],"Digital twin is a hot point nowadays, and has received great attention from both academia and industry. The first problem faced by users when utilizing digital twin is how to realize the modeling of a digital twin. However, model is a core part in any digital twin as well as its industrial application. Unfortunately, there is no criterion for digital twin modelling until now, and it lacks theoretical support for accurate modeling when studying and utilizing digital twin. For addressing this problem, the modelling criterion of digital twin was put forward. Then a theoretical system for digital twin modelling was established from six aspects, including model construction, model assembly, model fusion, model verification, model validation and model management. The proposed criterion and theory for digital twin modelling were applied in the construction of Digital Twin Shop-floor (DTS). Furthermore, three key technologies in DTS, including modeling of shop-floor elements, modeling of data-driven dynamic production process and modeling of production system simulation were studied in detail.These works were expected to provide theoretical references for the construction and application of digital twin in different industrial fields, especially in shop-floor. © 2021, Editorial Department of CIMS.

Conceiving a Digital Twin for a Flexible Manufacturing System,"Digitization and virtualization represent key factors in the era of Industry 4.0. Digital twins (DT) can certainly contribute to increasing the efficiency of various productive sectors as they can contribute to monitoring, managing, and improvement of a product or process throughout its life cycle. Although several works deal with DTs, there are gaps regarding the use of this technology when a Flexible Manufacturing System (FMS) is used. Existing work, for the most part, is concerned with simulating the progress of manufacturing without providing key production data in real-time. Still, most of the solutions presented in the literature are relatively expensive and may be difficult to implement in most companies, due to their complexity. In this work, the digital twin of an FMS is conceived. The specific module of an ERP (Enterprise Resources Planning) system is used to digitize the physical entity. Production data is entered according to tryouts performed in the FMS. Sensors installed in the main components of the FMS, CNC (computer numerical control) lathe, robotic arm, and pallet conveyor send information in real-time to the digital entity. The results show that simulations using the digital twin present very satisfactory results compared to the physical entity. In time, information such as production rate, queue management, feedstock, equipment, and pallet status can be easily accessed by operators and managers at any time during the production process, confirming the MES (manufacture execution system) efficiency. The low-cost hardware and software used in this work showed its feasibility. The DT created represents the initial step towards designing a metaverse solution for the manufacturing unit in question, which should operate in the near future as a smart and autonomous factory model. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,digital twin flexible manufacturing system Industry 4.0 simulation,academic,"Department of Industrial Technology, Federal University of Espírito Santo, Av.

The digital twin in Industry 4.0: A wide-angle perspective,"The move towards advanced manufacturing and Industry 4.0 is fed by increased demand for speeding up innovation, increasing flexibility, improving maintenance, and becoming more customized while saving on the total cost of operations. This is accompanied by increased dependence on virtual product and process development, data-driven processes, and product knowledge. Other characteristics, affecting modern design, include big data intelligence in product, process, and maintenance. New technologies that empower data analytics include added manufacturing, flexible manufacturing, robotics, sensor technology, smart value/supply chains, and industrial information backbones. This paper is about surrogate models, also called digital twins, that provide an important complementary capacity to physical assets. Digital twins capture past, present, and predicted behavior of physical assets. Digital twin models are updated periodically to represent the current state of physical assets. This distinguishes digital twins from conventional simulations in that sensor data can continuously feed them. The type of curated information on the state of physical asset's history depends on how digital twins are used. For example, if a digital twin is used for fault classification, the history captured is operational data from equipment in healthy and faulty states. We provide here a review of digital twins, with an emphasis on Industry 4.0 applications. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2022,Data Analytics Flexible manufacturing systems Industrial robots Industry 4.0 Product design Advanced manufacturing Cost of operations Data intelligence Fault classification Flexible manufacturing Process development Product knowledge Sensor technologies Digital twincondition-based maintenance digital twins Industry 4.0 information quality model calibration process control simulations,academic,"KPA Group, Raanana and Samuel Neaman Institute, Technion–Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel; Department of Mechanical Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel",15,0.21428571428571427
Digitalized Automation Engineering of Industry 4.0 Production Systems and Their Tight Cooperation with Digital Twins,"Smart production systems conforming the Industry 4.0 vision are based on subsystems that are integrated in a way that supports high flexibility and re-configurability. Specific components and devices, such as industrial and mobile robots or transport systems, now pose full-blown systems, and the entire Industry 4.0 production system constitutes a system-of-systems. Testing, fine-tuning, and production planning are important tasks in the entire engineering production system life-cycle. All these steps can be significantly supported and improved by digital twins, which are digitalized replicas of physical systems that are synchronized with the real systems at runtime. However, the design and implementation of digital twins for such integrated, yet partly stand-alone, industrial sub-systems can represent challenging and significantly time-consuming engineering tasks. In this article, the problem of the digital twin design for discrete-event production systems is addressed. The article also proposes to utilize a formal description of production resources and related production operations that the resources can perform. An executable version of such formalization can be automatically derived into a form of a digital twin. Such a derived digital twin can be enhanced with operation duration times that are obtained with process mining methods, leading to more realistic simulations for the entire production system. The proposed solution was successfully tested and validated in the Industry 4.0 Testbed, equipped with four robots and a transport system, which is utilized as a use-case in this article. © 2022 by the authors.

Digital Twin-Assisted Controlling of AGVs in Flexible Manufacturing Environments,"Digital Twins are increasingly being introduced for smart manufacturing systems to improve the efficiency of the main disciplines of such systems. Formal techniques, such as graphs, are a common way of describing Digital Twin models, allowing broad types of tools to provide Digital Twin based services such as fault detection in production lines. Obtaining correct and complete formal Digital Twins of physical systems can be a complicated and time consuming process, particularly for manufacturing systems with plenty of physical objects and the associated manufacturing processes. Automatic generation of Digital Twins is an emerging research field and can reduce time and costs. In this paper, we focus on the generation of Digital Twins for flexible manufacturing systems with Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) on the factory floor. In particular, we propose an architectural framework and the associated design choices and software development tools that facilitate automatic generation of Digital Twins for AGVs. Specifically, the scope of the generated digital twins is controlling AGVs in the factory floor. To this end, we focus on different control levels of AGVs and utilize graph theory to generate the graph-based Digital Twin of the factory floor. © 2021 IEEE.",2021,Automatic guided vehicles Fault detection Flexible manufacturing systems Floors Software design Agile manufacturing Automated guided vehicles Automatic Generation Factory floors Flexible manufacturing Layer controls Manufacturing environments Multi-layer control Multi-layers Smart manufacturing Graph theoryagile manufacturing AGV digital twin graph theory industry 4.0 multi-layer control,academic,"Aalto University, Department of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Espoo, Finland; University of Oslo, Department of Informatics, Oslo, Norway",15,0.20930232558139536

A Digital Twin Demonstrator to enable flexible manufacturing with robotics: a process supervision case study,"Manufacturing companies are facing different challenges. On the one hand, production is moving from mass-production to mass-customization and personalization. Reconfigurable-, adaptive- and evolving-factories are necessary to achieve the required flexibility. On the other hand, technology must be integrated with human skills to assist the operators in supervising and maintaining manufacturing plants with growing complexity. In line with the Industry 4.0 paradigm, a Digital Twin Demonstrator is proposed to support the supervision activity of the operator in the context of flexible manufacturing with robotics. The supervision is achieved through a Human-Computer-Machine Interaction (HCMI) enabled with the Digital Twin technology. The suggested demonstrator is implemented and validated using a lab case study where it is demonstrated how the proposed HCMI interaction enables ‘close-to-real-time’ supervision of the manufacturing system in its self-adaptation to production and environmental changes. © 2021 The Author(s).

Automated digital twins generation for manufacturing systems: A case study,"The recent industrial scenario was defined by the emergence of digital twins and cyber physical systems as key elements for manufacturers leadership. Digital models can perform good in terms of production planning and control decisions if they are correctly representing their physical counterparts at anytime. Discrete event simulation can be considered as established digital models of manufacturing system, thanks to the proven capabilities of correctly estimating the system performances. Automated simulation model generation techniques can significantly reduce model development phases and allow for using simulation models for short term decisions in production. Application studies and test cases are scarce in the literature. In this paper, we present the application of a digital model generation method. The test case is done exploiting a lab-scale model of a manufacturing system composed by six stations. We investigate how the model generation works online, during the transient phase of a manufacturing system. Results confirm the real-time applicability of the approach provided that sufficient data points are available from the production event logs. © 2021 The Authors.

A simulator coupling architecture for the creation of digital twins,"Digital Twins are digital representations of real-world entities. Their behavior resembles the behavior of the real entity at all times. They are candidates for the evaluation of complex adaptive embedded systems, for example in the domains of autonomous driving, or industry 4.0 production systems. However, as most simulators are specialized and only simulate selected aspects of a system with highest accuracy, the creation of a Digital Twin requires the coupling of simulators and their simulation models. Related work indicates that this is still a labor-intensive and manual task. In this paper, we present an architecture framework that transfers approaches from Component-Based Software Engineering to simulator coupling. Simulators are encapsulated as simulation components with defined interfaces. The creation of a Digital Twin is supported by orchestrating simulation components.

A digital twin ecosystem for additive manufacturing using a real-time development platform,"Additive manufacturing is often used in rapid prototyping and manufacturing, allowing the creation of lighter, more complex designs that are difficult or too expensive to build using traditional manufacturing methods. This work considers the implementation of a novel digital twin ecosystem that can be used for testing, process monitoring, and remote management of an additive manufacturing–fused deposition modeling machine in a simulated virtual environment. The digital twin ecosystem is comprised of two approaches. One approach is data-driven by an open-source 3D printer web controller application that is used to capture its status and key parameters. The other approach is data-driven by externally mounted sensors to approximate the actual behavior of the 3D printer and achieve accurate synchronization between the physical and virtual 3D printers. We evaluate the sensor-data-driven approach against the web controller approach, which is considered to be the ground truth. We achieve near-real-time synchronization between the physical machine and its digital counterpart and have validated the digital twin in terms of position, temperature, and run duration. Our digital twin ecosystem is cost-efficient, reliable, replicable, and hence can be utilized to provide legacy equipment with digital twin capabilities, collect historical data, and generate analytics. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2022,Deposition Ecosystems Process monitoring Simulation platform Virtual reality Data driven Deposition modeling Development platform Fused deposition modeling Manufacturing IS Rapid-prototyping Real- time Simulation Time development Unity 3d 3D printersAdditive manufacturing Digital twin Fused deposition modeling Simulation Unity 3D,academic,"Industrial and Systems Engineering, Auburn University, 357-359 W Magnolia Ave, Auburn, 36832, AL, United States",45,0.23684210526315788
A Digital Twin Approach for the Prediction of the Geometry of Single Tracks Produced by Laser Metal Deposition,"Flexible manufacturing processes such as laser metal deposition exhibit high potential for a production solely defined by software to cope with the current challenges of production systems.

Digital twin-based job shop anomaly detection and dynamic scheduling,"Scheduling scheme is one of the critical factors affecting the production efficiency. In the actual production, anomalies will lead to scheduling deviation and influence scheme execution, which makes the traditional job shop scheduling methods are not sufficient to meet the needs of real-time and accuracy. By introducing digital twin (DT), further convergence between physical and virtual space can be achieved, which enormously reinforces real-time performance of job shop scheduling. For flexible job shop, an anomaly detection and dynamic scheduling framework based on DT is proposed in this paper. Previously, a multi-level production process monitoring model is proposed to detect anomaly. Then, a real-time optimization strategy of scheduling scheme based on rolling window mechanism is explored to enforce dynamic scheduling optimization. Finally, the improved grey wolf optimization algorithm is introduced to solve the scheduling problem. Under this framework, it is possible to monitor the deviation between the actual processing state and the planned processing state in real time and effectively reduce the deviation. An equipment manufacturing job shop is taken as a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed framework. © 2022",2023,Anomaly detection Dynamics Job shop scheduling Process control Production efficiency Digital twin Gray wolf optimization algorithm Gray wolves Level productions Monitoring models Multi-level production process monitoring model Multilevels Optimization algorithms Optimization strategy Production process Real time scheduling Real-time scheduling optimization strategy Rolling window Rolling window mechanism Scheduling optimization Process monitoringDigital twin (DT) Grey wolf optimization algorithm Multi-level production process monitoring model Real-time scheduling optimization strategy Rolling window mechanism,academic,"School of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Department of Production Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden; Hubei Digital Manufacturing Key Laboratory, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, 430070, China",59,0.20588235294117646
Digital twin-based production scheduling system for heavy truck frame shop,"Existing scheduling systems cannot respond quickly and efficiently to the appearance of uncertain variable interference factors in the scheduling process. The efficiency of the enterprise is hence seriously affected by these factors. The concept of the digital twin provides new research directions for scheduling systems. In order to improve the overall performance of the production scheduling system in a frame shop, virtual-real fusion technology utilizing the digital twin is first introduced to integrate the information and logistics flows in the scheduling process as part of the manufacturing execution system-based production scheduling mechanism.

This makes a great impact on workshop scheduling. Aiming at this problem, this paper designs a real-time workshop digital twin scheduling platform for discrete manufacturing. It improves the flexibility of the intelligent workshop and the response processing speed after dynamic disturbance. The platform can real-time monitor of the physical workshop and track orders, products, equipment and other information. Further, the platform and visualization technology were explored to work together. Then, the true display of changes after production line decision was displayed.

Typology of Manufacturing Digital Twins: A First Step Towards a Deployment Methodology,"The digital twin is not only a recent technology but also a polymorphic concept which generates a profusion of publications without real coherence because they relate to very different realities including various definitions, shapes, models and applications. If a wide variety of architectures are proposed, there is a significant lack of information on how to deploy a digital twin efficiently and how to define an appropriate architecture. We propose the first step of a complete deployment methodology consisting of a typology that defines the main criteria required to determine not only the digital twin components but also their organization. Based on different recent works that have been synthesized and completed, eleven criteria have been selected as representative of the set of usages and applications proposed in the literature.

Digital Twins for the built environment: learning from conceptual and process models in manufacturing,"The overall aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm in the built environment by drawing inspiration from existing DT research in manufacturing. The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT's structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors. © 2021",2021,Architectural design Digital twin E-learning Embedded systems Engineering education Information theory Manufacture Academic publications Building Information Modelling Communication models Cyber-physical systems (CPS) Product life managements Research frameworks Service-based model System architectures Industrial researchBIM Conceptual Models Cyber-Physical Systems Digital Twin Maturity Models Process Models,academic,"Big Data Enterprise and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Faculty of Business and Law, University of West of England (UWE) Bristol, Coldharbour Lane, Bristol, BS16 1QY, United Kingdom",80,0.27906976744186046

5-dimensional definition for a manufacturing digital twin,"The Digital Twin is a recently developed innovative technology in Industry 4.0. The cyber-physical system (CPS) is a concept closely connected with Industry 4.0 that can form a basis for creating a Digital Twin. In this paper, a comprehensive model of a Digital Twin approach for a manufacturing environment and related production processes is proposed. The presented model is based on combining a 5-Dimensional definition for the Digital Twin and cloud-based CPS (C2PS) architecture. The model consists of five layers to replicate the physical object as a virtual object and to collect and convert data. Analysis of the virtual model for prediction of future development, decision-making, re-configuration, what-if analysis, and understanding of the effect of changes in the real time process is performed in the fourth layer. The user interface layer is the connection between the virtual and physical model. Use of a Digital Twin in manufacturing enables improvement in the effectiveness of Lean Manufacturing, leading to savings in resources such as cost and time. Uncertainties inherent in manufacturing processes mean that the Digital Twin approach is a more suitable method for optimization of the overall process and the sub-processes than pure simulation. An accurate Digital Twin model can improve safety, save costs, speed up manufacturing of new products and implementation of new processes, and provide global optimization results. In practice, however, provision of data is a challenge to use of the Digital Twin approach because modern manufacturing uses a variety of data in different formats with different owners. Access to all required data and information and obtaining permission for its use in creation of a Digital Twin is a topic for future research. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Using open-source microcontrollers to enable digital twin communication for smart manufacturing,"One of the key enabling technologies for the smart factory is the Digital Twin, which can be described as a digital model of a physical entity. In smart manufacturing, a digital twin, also referred to as a cyber-physical production system, comprises three integrated components: the product, the process and the machine. In this paper, the design, fabrication and development of a proof of principal manufacturing digital twin demonstrator is discussed. The manufacturing process is a V-bending operation of a thin metallic plate. All three components of a manufacturing digital twin are represented: the metallic plate product, the bending process and the bending machine. Low-cost, IoT-enabled, open-source microcontrollers are used to communicate between the physical and the digital twins. The microcontroller is used to control machine operations, while also extracting sensor data from the system. It is demonstrated that the digital twin enables real-time stress prediction in the product during the bending process, while also tracking and recording machine performance. An information dashboard has also been developed which presents key performance indicators to the end user. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Construction of intelligent integrated model framework for the workshop manufacturing system via digital twin,"With the boosting development of the advanced manufacturing industry in the world, the original production pattern transformed from the traditional industries into the intelligence mode is completed with the least delay possible, which are still facing new challenges. The timeliness, stability, and reliability of them are significantly restricted due to the lack of real-time communication. Therefore, a model framework of intelligent workshop manufacturing system based on a digital twin is proposed in this paper, driving the deep information integration among the physical entity, data collection, and information decision-making. The traditional digital twin of conceptualization and fuzziness needs to be refined, optimized, and upgraded on the basis of the four-dimension collaborative model thinking. The model framework of a refined nine-layer intelligent digital twin is established. Firstly, the physical evaluation is refined into entity layer, auxiliary layer, and interface layer, scientific managing the physical resources and the instrument, and coordinating the overall system. Secondly, dividing the data evaluation into the data layer and the processing layer can greatly improve the flexible response-ability and ensure the synchronization of the real-time data. Finally, the system evaluation is subdivided into information layer, algorithm layer, scheduling layer, and functional layer, developing flexible manufacturing plan more reasonably, shortening the production cycle, and reducing logistics cost. Simultaneously, combining SLP and artificial bee colonies is applied to investigate the production system optimization of the textile workshop.

Improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation: application in a digital twin shop floor,"In recent years, the literature has paid considerable attention to digital twin technology for the implementation of Industry 4.0 and intelligent manufacturing. Most of the literature argues that simulation models are a key platform for digital twins and considers discrete-event simulation to be a suitable method to model real dynamic manufacturing systems. However, the discrete-event simulation of complex manufacturing systems is a time-consuming process. Therefore, it is difficult to deal with the large-scale discrete optimisation problems in digital twin shop floors. To bridge this research gap, we propose an improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation method based on multi-fidelity optimisation with ordinal transformation and optimal sampling (MO2TOS) in the current research. The proposed method embeds heuristic algorithms to accelerate the solution space search efficiency in MO2TOS. Moreover, we develop an improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation system by integrating the proposed method with discrete-event simulation tools and apply this system to a digital twin-based aircraft parts production workshop. Based on this digital twin shop floor, we conduct different production planning experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed improved multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation method is well-applied in solving large-scale problems and outperforms other simulation-based optimisation methods. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,Discrete event simulation Floors Heuristic algorithms Heuristic methods Manufacture Optimization Production control Complex manufacturing systems Discrete optimisation Intelligent Manufacturing Large-scale problem Multi-fidelity simulation Production Planning Production workshops Simulation based optimisation Digital twindigital twin shop floor heuristic algorithms large-scale problem optimisation Multi-fidelity simulation-based optimisation simulation,academic,"School of Mechanical Science and Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China; EMLYON Business School, Ecully, France",107,0.36363636363636365

Digital twin-driven rapid reconfiguration of the automated manufacturing system via an open architecture model,"Increasing individualization demands in products call for high flexibility in the manufacturing systems to adapt changes. This paper proposes a novel digital twin-driven approach for rapid reconfiguration of automated manufacturing systems.

The results of the optimization part are fed back to the semi-physical simulation for verification. Open-architecture machine tool (OAMT) is defined and developed as a new class of machine tools comprising a fixed standard platform and various individualized modules that can be added and rapidly swapped. Engineers can flexibly reconfigure the manufacturing system for catering to process planning by integrating personalized modules into its OAMTs. Key enabling techniques, including how to twin cyber and physical system and how to quickly bi-level program the production capacity and functionality of manufacturing systems to adapt rapid changes of products, are detailed.

Moreover, digital shadow and digital twin are embedded in this framework, being discussed in the context of a state-of-the-art literature review. The main part of this paper addresses models for machine and path inaccuracies, material removal and tool engagement, cutting force, process stability, thermal behavior, workpiece and surface properties. Furthermore, these models are superimposed towards an integral digital twin. In addition, the overall context is expanded towards an integral software architecture of a digital twin providing information system. The information system, in turn, ties in with existing forward-oriented planning from operational practice, leading to a significant expansion of the initially presented basic structure for a digital twin. Consequently, a time-stratified data layer platform is introduced to prepare for the resulting shadow-twin transformation loop. Finally, subtasks are defined to assure functional interfaces, model integrability and feedback measures. © 2021 by the authors.

Improvement of factory planning by automated generation of a digital twin,"The simulation of processes in production systems is a powerful tool for factory planning. The application of simulation methods within the Digital Factory is becoming increasingly relevant as developments in the field of digitalization lead to more comprehensive, efficient, embedded and cost-effective simulation methods. Especially the integration within a Digital Twin, allows these advantages to be achieved for simulations. Here, the Digital Twin can be utilized for prospective planning, analysis of existing systems or process-oriented monitoring.

An Integrated Platform for Multi-Model Digital Twins,"The notion of Digital Twin is known as a means to access otherwise dispersed lifecycle data of industrial devices, and enabling advanced reasoning on top of the data via various kinds of models (e.g. machine learning, simulation).

"Digital twin of mRNA-based SARS-COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing towards autonomous operation for improvements in speed, scale, robustness, flexibility and real-time release testing","Supplying SARS-COVID-19 vaccines in quantities to meet global demand has a bottleneck in manufacturing capacity. Assessment of existing mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccine processing shows the need for digital twins enabled by process analytical technology approaches to improve process transfers for manufacturing capacity multiplication, reduction of out-of-specification batch failures, qualified personnel training for faster validation and efficient operation, optimal utilization of scarce buffers and chemicals, and faster product release. A digital twin of the total pDNA (plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid) to mRNA process is proposed. In addition, a first feasibility of multisensory process analytical technology (PAT) is shown. Process performance characteristics are derived as results and evaluated regarding manufacturing technology bottlenecks. Potential improvements could be pointed out such as dilution reduction in lysis, and potential reduction of necessary chromatography steps. 1 g pDNA may lead to about 30 g mRNA. This shifts the bottleneck towards the mRNA processing step, which points out co-transcriptional capping as a preferred option to reduce the number of purification steps. Purity demands are fulfilled by a combination of mixed-mode and reversed-phase chromatography as established unit operations on a higher industrial readiness level than e.g., precipitation and ethanol-chloroform extraction. As a final step, lyophilization was chosen for stability, storage and transportation logistics. Alternative process units like UF/DF (ultra-/diafiltration) integration would allow the adjustment of final concentration and buffer composition before lipid-nano particle (LNP) formulation. The complete digital twin is proposed for further validation in manufacturing scale and utilization in process optimization and manufacturing operations. The first PAT results should be followed by detailed investigation of different batches and processing steps in order to implement this strategy for process control and reliable, efficient operation. © 2021 by the authors.

At the same time, it is worth noting that the role of standards in creating “digital mines” and “mines of the future” is difficult to overestimate. Digitalization and standardization are closely interrelated processes. The only correct way to integrate the devices, information systems and digital models used in mining enterprises is based primarily on technical standards and regulations, which in turn strengthen the Foundation for intelligent digital production in the industry. In order to ensure the compatibility of mining and geological, mining and technological and technical parameters, intelligent management systems and data analysis, as well as the interaction of various departments of mining enterprises with government services, it is necessary to create industry standards for digital production. This article highlights the main stages of the creating process a frame model of the excavation chamber in the GGIS, analyzes the standard set of attributes frame models of element’s the underground mining system solid mineral deposits (excavation chambers, treatment faces, technological units, panels, blocks, floors of preparatory workings, security pillars, etc.) in the GGIS and user attributes necessary for formalization of technological 3D models.

A Novel Implementation Framework of Digital Twins for Intelligent Manufacturing Based on Container Technology and Cloud Manufacturing Services,"Many core technologies of Industry 4.0 have gained substantial advancement in recent years. Digital Twin (DT) has become the key technology and tool for manufacturing industries to realize intelligent cyber-physical integration and digital transformation by leveraging these technologies. Although there have been many DT-related works, there is no standard definition, unified framework, and implementation approach of DT until now. Widely developing DTs for the manufacturing industry is still challenging. Thus, this paper proposes a novel implementation framework of digital twins for intelligent manufacturing, denoted as IF-DTiM, which possesses several distinct merits to distinguish itself from previous works. First, IF-DTiM fully utilizes new-generation container technology so that DT-related applications and services can be packaged in a self-contained way, rapidly deployed, and robustly operated with the capabilities of failover, autoscaling, and load balancing. Second, it leverages existing intelligent cloud manufacturing services to realize the intelligence for DT externally in a scalable and plug-and-play manner instead of using traditional approaches to embed intelligence in DT. Third, IF-DTiM contains Product DT for products, Equipment DT (i.e., EQ DT) for equipment, and Process DT for production lines, which can generically fulfill the demands and scenarios to achieve intelligent manufacturing for various manufacturing industries. Testing results show that IF-DTiM can achieve remarkable performance in rapid deployment and real-time data exchanges of DT-related applications. Finally, we develop an example DTiM system for CNC machining based on IF-DTiM to demonstrate its efficacy and applicability in facilitating the manufacturing industry to build their DT systems. Note to Practitioners - Developing Digital Twin (DT) systems to realize intelligent manufacturing is challenging. The proposed IF-DTiM (Implementation Framework of Digital Twins for Intelligent Manufacturing) provides a novel container-technology and cloud-manufacturing-service-based systematic methodology for building DTiM. In this paper, we present the system architecture and several operational scenarios (e.g., how to create and use DTs) of IF-DTiM, together with the design of its core functional mechanisms (e.g., rapid deployment scheme for DT, real-time data exchange for DT, DT interface pattern, and general workflow architecture for DT). Also, an example DTiM system for CNC machining based on IF-DTiM is presented to facilitate the practitioners to adopt the designs and niches in IF-DTiM to build their desired DTiM systems.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",2022,Computer aided manufacturing Electronic data interchange Industry 4.0 Cloud Manufacturing Cloud-computing Container technology.

Sustainable Manufacturing Digital Twins: A Review of Development and Application,"Sustainable manufacturing as a concept as well as the practices that are deployed are well established in the literature. Tools that guide the development of manufacturing to have less environmental impact are being deployed and documented. The power of digital technology to enable manufacturing systems to be more productive is well established and advances continue to be made. What is less well known is how digital technology can support the pursuit of sustainable manufacturing, especially using digital models, shadows and twins. Here a digital simulation model is configured to analyse, replicate and drive the real production respectively to improve resource productivity in the widest sense. This paper considers the literature and practice of such digital tools in manufacturing operations as well as across the lifecycle. Literature considered is mostly from 2018 onwards as this is the point at which digital twin empirical work emerges. Whilst the work on digital twins is advancing fast, the work on sustainable manufacturing is limited to energy and, to some extent, resource efficiency. Further when compared to documented practice, the academic field appears to be lagging depending on how the loose definition of digital twins in practice is interpreted.

Manufacturing resilience and agility through processes digital twin: Design and testing applied in the LPBF case,"Digital twins can be very promising towards offering agility and resilience in manufacturing. Especially at process level, the adaptability and the real-time optimization they can bring along is highly desired. However, digital twins, being the outcome of severe systems integration are difficult to be designed and be implemented integrating all the desired functions, such as process control and quality assessment. This work investigates the opportunity to integrate different models under the concept of a digital twin of a manufacturing process (namely LPBF) and be able to meet diverse requirements, such as adaptivity, real-time optimization and uncertainty management. The suggested framework takes into account all the phases of the digital twin, such as sensorization, modelling, diagnostic and prognostic functions and puts together an architecture including all available models and thus paving the way towards achieving to meet all the requirements.

Digital-twin enabled experimentation testbed for mbse,"As Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) continues to advance in terms of system life cycle coverage, modeling languages, methods, and tools, there is a growing need for an overarching framework to organize MBSE artifacts and facilitate their rapid retrieval and use by MBSE researchers. Also, researchers need a simulation environment that supports exploration, experimentation with different modeling constructs and algorithms, and performance data collection over a broad range of conditions and with different assumptions. To address these requirements, this paper presents progress to date in developing a MBSE research testbed for modeling, experimentation, and verification and validation, and exploration of system behaviors over a wide range of operational scenarios and operating conditions. The testbed is intended to help researchers analyze data to uncover patterns and trends, reuse models and components as applicable, and serve as a repository for scenarios, system models, case studies, and lessons learned. Two different operational scenarios from different domains are used to convey the capabilities of the testbed.

Digital twins: Understanding the added value of integrated models for through-life engineering services,"Digital twins are digital representations of physical products or systems that consist of multiple models from various domains describing them on multiple scales. By means of communication, digital twins change and evolve together with their physical counterparts throughout their lifecycle. Domain-specific partial models that make up the digital twin, such as the CAD model or the degradation model, are usually well known and provide accurate descriptions of certain parts of the physical asset. However, in complex systems, the value of integrating the partial models increases because it facilitates the study of their complex behaviours which only emerge from the interactions between various parts of the system. The paper proposes that the partial models of the digital twin share a common model space that integrates them through a definition of their interrelations and acts as a bridge between the digital twin and the physical asset. The approach is illustrated in a case of a mechatronic product - a differential drive mobile robot developed as a testbed for digital twin research. It is demonstrated how the integrated models add value to different stages of the lifecycle, allowing for evaluation of performance in the design stage and real-time reflection with the physical asset during its operation. © 2018 The Authors.

Model-based automatic generation of digital twin models for the simulation of reconfigurable manufacturing systems for timber construction,"Reconfigurable manufacturing systems adapt to changing requirements and therefore offer a solution to the challenges associated with increasing product variety and shorter product life cycles. This is especially helpful in the prefabrication in timber construction, as components and requirements vary widely between projects. However, reconfigurations must be quick to keep downtimes short. The planning of reconfigurations is a complex problem where digital twins and simulation models of the manufacturing systems are necessary for simulation and validation. In our timber prefabrication use case, building components and requirements change from project to project, and the manufacturing system needs to reconfigure frequently. The building components and the configuration of the manufacturing system are designed simultaneously during a co-design process to ensure the integrity of the manufacturing process in a changing manufacturing environment. Hence, this may require many iterations of the planning process. Each iteration needs validation through a simulation. However, the manual generation of simulation models is time-consuming and error-prone and thus poses an obstacle for the digital planning phase. This paper addresses this issue and presents a model-based approach to generate simulation models for reconfigurable manufacturing systems. Our system and its components are modeled in automation markup language as this domain-specific language allows us to model not only kinematics and geometry but also behavior, skills, and interfaces to check the compatibility of components. We apply the method to our use case with the IntCDC wood prefabrication system. The proposed method builds a component graph for a configuration of the manufacturing system and generates the required packages for the simulation in Gazebo and ROS. To build simulation models automatically, we apply model-to-model and model-to-text transformation techniques. The proposed method is suitable for integration in the digital co-design workflow of IntCDC and allows fast iterations with continuous simulations of machine configurations throughout the planning process. © 2022 The Authors.

Evolutionary digital twin model with an agent-based discrete-event simulation method,"A digital twin model provides the ability to adjust candidate behavior based on feedback from its physical part. However, small interactions between different subsystems and using real-time data about physical workshops are the primary problems in digital twin models. The essence of the digital twin model is the combination of the physical simulation method and the data-driven simulation method, and agent-based discrete-event modeling theory is an advanced way to build a digital twin model. Thus, the theoretical framework of the Digital Twin Workshop model is improved from the underlying modeling logic based on this new theory. By combining reinforcement learning with the digital twin workshop model, an evolutionary digital twin workshop model is developed in this study. This model is then applied to a real-world case. A comparison is made between the Digital Twin Workshop model with reinforcement learning policy and a heuristic policy and a random policy.

A five-step approach to planning data-driven digital twins for discrete manufacturing systems,"A digital twin of a manufacturing system is a digital copy of the physical manufacturing system that consists of various digital models at multiple scales and levels. Digital twins that communicate with their physical counterparts throughout their lifecycle are the basis for data-driven factories. The problem with developing digital models that form the digital twin is that they operate with large amounts of heterogeneous data. Since the models represent simplifications of the physical world, managing the heterogeneous data and linking the data with the digital twin represent a challenge. The paper proposes a five-step approach to planning data-driven digital twins of manufacturing systems and their processes. The approach guides the user from breaking down the system and the underlying building blocks of the processes into four groups. The development of a digital model includes predefined necessary parameters that allow a digital model connecting with a real manufacturing system. The connection enables the control of the real manufacturing system and allows the creation of the digital twin. Presentation and visualization of a system functioning based on the digital twin for different participants is presented in the last step. The suitability of the approach for the industrial environment is illustrated using the case study of planning the digital twin for material logistics of the manufacturing system. © 2021 by the authors.

Building Discrete-Event Simulation for Digital Twin Applications in Production Systems,"Digital equivalence is the main objective of Digital Twin (DT)s, and simulation is an integral part. DTs reach beyond traditional simulation with the help of real-time synchronization through Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies. Simulation supports off-line experimentations and planning, while DTs offer synchronous execution and modification. DTs help to understand 'what may happen'. Also, they present 'what is happening' and its management methodologies. In this paper, we present building aspects and an integration approach for a Digital Twin based Discrete-Event Simulation model. Our approach utilizes a data-driven agent-based simulation within a DT framework. It presents an integration layer that provides two essential features: reconfiguration and state initialization.

A discrete event simulation based approach for digital twin implementation,"Nowadays, manufacturing companies need to improve their production monitoring and prediction to be more flexible and re-configurable. To do so, the digitization of the manufacturing environment is a very critical issue. This paper proposes an approach to develop digital twins in this environment. Digital twins are virtual systems, real time connected with their physical counterpart, which replicate exactly their behaviour.

Continuous adaption through real data analysis turn simulation models into digital twins,"Digital twins of production systems enable new forms of production control, flexibility and continuous improvement. While off-the-shelf software for discrete-event simulation permits the fast implementation of rough simulation models with sufficient accuracy for project-based analysis, they lack the precision and generality of a digital twin. This paper presents an approach to close the gap between model and reality by continuous and iterative updates enabled by connecting the simulation model to IT systems and smart data analysis.

Hierarchical Aggregation/Disaggregation for Adaptive Abstraction-Level Conversion in Digital Twin-Based Smart Semiconductor Manufacturing,"In smart manufacturing, engineers typically analyze unexpected real-time problems using digitally cloned discrete-event (DE) models for wafer fabrication. To achieve a faster response to problems, it is essential to increase the speed of DE simulations because making optimal decisions for addressing the issues requires repeated simulations. This paper presents a hierarchical aggregation/disaggregation (A/D) method that substitutes complex event-driven operations with two-layered abstracted models-single-group mean-delay models (SMDMs) and multi-group MDMs (MMDMs)-to gain simulation speedup. The SMDM dynamically abstracts a DE machine group's behaviors into observed mean-delay constants when the group converges into a steady state. The MMDM fast-forwards the input lots by bypassing the chained processing steps in multiple steady-state groups until it schedules the lots for delivery to subsequent unsteady groups after corresponding multi-step mean delays. The key component, the abstraction-level converter (ALC), has the roles of MMDM allocation, deallocation, extension, splitting, and controls the flow of each group's input lot by deciding the destination DE model, SMDM, and MMDMs. To maximize the reuse of previously computed multi-step delays for the dynamically changing MMDMs, we propose an efficient method to manage the delays using two-level caches. Each steady-state group's ALC performs statistical testing to detect the lot-arrival change to reactivate the DE model. However, fast-forwarding (FF) results in incorrect test results of the bypassed group's ALCs due to the missed observations of the bypassed lots. Thus, we propose a method for test-sample reinitialization that considers the bypassing. Moreover, since a bypassed group's unexpected divergence can change the multi-step delays of previously scheduled events, a method for examination of FF history is designed to trace the highly influenced events. This proposed method has been applied in various case studies, and it has achieved speedups of up to about 5.9 times, with 2.5 to 8.3% degradation in accuracy.  © 2013 IEEE.",2021,Cloning Digital twin Semiconductor device manufacture Hierarchical aggregation Missed observations Multiple steady state Real-time problems Semiconductor manufacturing Simulation speed-up Smart manufacturing Statistical testing Discrete event simulationAbstraction-level conversion aggregation/disaggregation discrete-event modeling smart manufacturing wafer fabrication,academic,"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, 639798, Singapore; School of Electronics Engineering, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, 41566, South Korea",181,0.23529411764705882
Developing digital twins for production enterprises,"This article presents a new approach to developing digital twins of production companies with the use of simulation methods. It describes the concept of digital twins as an integrated system that aggregates simulation models, databases and intelligent software modules of the class of genetic optimization algorithms, subsystems of data mining, etc. The article presents examples of simulation models of different production companies, in particular, a typical assembly plant and a typical oil production enterprise. The first company carries out activities to assembly products from individual components with its own individual characteristics. To describe the behavior of such an enterprise, methods of agent and discrete-event modeling are used. The second enterprise produces raw carbohydrate materials at existing fields with individual characteristics. The integrated simulation models thus developed are integrated with a subject-oriented database and optimization modules that facilitate providing a control of the technological and resource characteristics of the respective production enterprises.

A Simulation Based Approach to Digital Twin’s Interoperability Verification & Validation,"The digital twins of production systems are one of the pillars of the Indus-try of the Future. Despite numerous on-going research and development initiatives the verification and validation of the digital twin remains a major scientific obstacle. This work proposes a simulation-based approach to achieve this goal: support Digital Twin verification and validation through the definition of a dedicated framework. A simulation model is used in place of the real-world system for ensuring the digital twin behaves as expected and for assessing its proper interoperability with the system to be twinned with. Then the simulation model is replaced by the real-world sys-tem, to interoperate with the verified and validated digital twin. With such an approach, the interoperability middleware, i.e. the IoT between the sys-tem and its digital twin can also be modeled, simulated, verified and vali-dated. Consequently, an optimized solution can be built for an entire value chain, from the system to its digital twin and conversely. © 2022 CEUR-WS.

Embedded digital twin for ARTI-type control of semi-continuous production processes,"The paper defines the structure and utilisation mode of an embedded aggregate digital twin for the hybrid supervised control of semi-continuous production process.

A Digital Twin-Based Automatic Programming Method for Adaptive Control of Manufacturing Cells,"The booming personalized and customized demands of customers in Industry 4.0 pose a great challenge for manufacturing enterprises in terms of flexibility and responsiveness. Nowadays, many effective dynamic scheduling approaches have been proposed for manufacturing systems to quickly respond to changes in customer demands, where, however, the implementation of an automatic programming method with high control accuracy and low control delay is still challenging. The above unaddressed issue brings about a lot of labor-intensive and time-consuming manual offline programming work when adjusting the scheduling scheme to meet dynamic customer demands, resulting in limited flexibility and responsiveness in current manufacturing systems. To bridge this gap, a bi-level adaptive control architecture enabled by an automatic programming method is proposed and embedded into a digital twin manufacturing cell (DTMC). The bi-level architecture aims to automatically map an input task scheduling scheme with a batch of jobs into a group of control programs through a behavior model network and a set of event models embedded in DTMC. It also provides an adaptive program modification mechanism to quickly adapt to the dynamic adjustment of the scheduling scheme caused by the changing of customer demands or production conditions, thus equipping DTMC with strong flexibility and responsiveness. Based on the bi-level architecture, a DTMC prototype system is developed, where its application and evaluation examples demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2013 IEEE.",2022,Behavioral research Flexible manufacturing systems Industry 4.0 Job shop scheduling Memory architecture Network architecture Sales Software prototyping Adaptation models Adaptive Control Aerospace electronics Behaviour models Customer demands Dynamic scheduling Event model Job-Shop scheduling Manufacturing Adaptive control systemsadaptive control automatic programming behavior model Digital twin event model industry 4.0,academic,"School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'An Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710049, China; State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'An Jiaotong University, Xi'an, 710054, China",221,0.25
Digital twin application with horizontal coordination for reinforcement-learning-based production control in a re-entrant job shop,"In a re-entrant job shop (RJS), an entity can visit the same resource type multiple times; this is called re-entrancy, which occurs frequently in actual industries. Re-entrancy causes an NP-hard problem and is dominated by heuristics-based production control. The stochastic arrivals due to re-entrancy require the design of an appropriate dispatching rule. Reinforcement learning (RL) is an efficient technique for establishing robust dispatching rules; however, only a few cases that coordinate RL-based production control with a digital twin (DT) have been reported. This study proposes a novel production control model that applies a DT and horizontal coordination with RL-based production control. The requirements for dispatching in the RJS and coordination between RL and the DT were defined. A suitable architectural framework, service composition, and systematic logic library schema were developed to exploit the advanced characteristics of the DT and improve the existing production control methods. This study is an early case of coordinating RL and DT, and the findings revealed that RL policy networks should be imported in the creation procedures rather than being synchronised to the DT. The results should be a valuable reference for research on other types of RL-based production control with regard to horizontal coordination. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,Digital twin E-learning NP-hard Production control Reinforcement learning Stochastic systems Architectural frameworks Dispatching rules Job shop Policy networks Production control model Service compositions Stochastic arrivals Job shop schedulingAsset administration shell digital twin production control re-entrant job shop reinforcement learning,academic,"Department of Industrial Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon-si, South Korea; Digital Factory Solution R&D Center, MICUBE Solution Inc., Seoul, South Korea",221,0.23076923076923078
Smart digital twin for ZDM-based job-shop scheduling,"The growing digitization of manufacturing processes is revolutionizing the production job-shop by leading it toward the Smart Manufacturing (SM) paradigm. For a process to be smart, it is necessary to combine a given blend of data technologies, information and knowledge that enable it to perceive its environment and to autonomously perform actions that maximize its success possibilities in its assigned tasks. Of all the different ways leading to this transformation, both the generation of virtual replicas of processes and applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide a wide range of possibilities whose exploration is today a far from negligible sources of opportunities to increase industrial companies' competitiveness. As a complex manufacturing process, production order scheduling in the job-shop is a necessary scenario to act by implementing these technologies. This research work considers an initial conceptual smart digital twin (SDT) framework for scheduling job-shop orders in a zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) environment. The SDT virtually replicates the job-shop scheduling issue to simulate it and, based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology, trains a prescriber agent and a process monitor.

Dynamic production scheduling of digital twin job-shop based on edge computing,"The current production scheduling models cannot effectively enable the real-time interaction between information space and physical space. To dynamically schedule twin digital job-shop, this paper attempts to realize the dynamic scheduling of digital twin job-shop (DTJ) based on edge computing.

On this basis, the DTJ was fully modelled, and the manufacturing process was monitored, analyzed and managed remoted by edge computing. To realize dynamic scheduling, a DTJ scheduling model was established through data mining. The model consists of two parts: a data collection model and a multi-scheduling knowledge model.

Job Shop Scheduling Based on Digital Twin Technology: A Survey and an Intelligent Platform,"The concept of digital twinning has become a hot topic in the manufacturing industry in recent years.

Digital twin based optimization of a manufacturing execution system to handle high degrees of customer specifications,"Lean production principles have greatly contributed to the efficient and customer-oriented mass production of goods and services. A core element of lean production is the focus on cycle times and designing production controls and buffers around any bottlenecks in the system. Hence, a production line organized by lean principles will operate in a static or at least quasi-static way. While the individualization of products is an interesting business approach, it can influence cycle times and in-time production. This work demonstrates how performance losses induced by highly variable cycle times can be recovered using a digital twin. The unit under analysis is an industrial joiner’s workshop. Due to the high variance in cycle time, the joinery fails its production target, even if all machines are below 80% usage. Using a discrete event simulation of the production line, different production strategies can be evaluated efficiently and systematically. It is successfully shown that the performance losses due to the highly variable cycle times can be compensated using a digital twin in combination with optimization strategies. This is achieved by operating the system in a non-static mode, exploiting the flexibilities within the systems. © 2020 by the authors.

Analysis of a closed-loop digital twin using discrete event simulation,"Given recent advancements in technology and recognizing the evolution of smart manufacturing, the implementation of digital twins for factories and processes is becoming more common and more useful. Additionally, expansion in connectivity, growth in data storage, and the implementation of the industrial internet of things (IIoT) allow for greater opportunities not only with digital twins but with closed loop analytics. Discrete event simulation (DES) has been used to create digital twins and, in some instances, fitted with live connections to closely monitor factory operations. However, the benefits of a connected digital twin are not easily quantified. Therefore, a test bed demonstration factory was used, which implements smart technologies, to evaluate the effectiveness of a closed-loop digital twin in identifying and reacting to trends in production. This involves a digital twin of a factory process using DES. Although traditional DES is typically modeled using historical data, a DES system was developed which made use of live data to improve predictions. This model had live data updated directly to the DES model without user interaction, creating an adaptive and dynamic model. It was found that this DES with live data typically provided more accurate predictions of future performance and unforeseen near future problems when compared to the predictions of a traditional DES using only historic data, resulting in smarter decisions and implementation of more timely solutions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2022,Digital storage Flow control Forecasting Manufacture Closed-loop Closed-loop process Data storage Discrete-event simulations Loop process Real-time factory Real-time factory analytic Smart manufacturing Smart technology Test bed demonstrations Discrete event simulationClosed-loop processes Digital twin Discrete event simulation Real-time factory analytics Smart manufacturing,academic,"Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, United States; Northrop Grumman, Promontory, UT, United States; University of California Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, United States",235,0.3170731707317073
"Past, present, and future research of digital twin for smart manufacturing","In the era of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, there is a growing focus on digital twin (DT) in order to advance toward smart manufacturing. Thus, researchers have conducted numerous studies on DT and extensively developed related technologies. There are many studies that apply and analyse DT to actual manufacturing sites for the realization of a smart factory, but it is necessary to clearly consider which part of DT is applied and what function it performs in manufacturing. As such, this study analysed and classified prior literature based on various phases of product lifecycle management, an application field of DT in manufacturing, and the hierarchy level axis of Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0, the target scope of DT. Accordingly, this study identified research trends in the past and present as well as analysed and identified the major functions of DT (prototyping, pilot testing, monitoring, improvement, and control). Through a gab study on the inadequate aspects of past and present researches, this study proposes directions for future studies on DT and a system architecture that can perform all the functions of DT.  © 2022 Society for Computational Design and Engineering.

A framework for data-driven digital twins for smart manufacturing,"Adoption of digital twins in smart factories, that model real statuses of manufacturing systems through simulation with real time actualization, are manifested in the form of increased productivity, as well as reduction in costs and energy consumption. The sharp increase in changing customer demands has resulted in factories transitioning rapidly and yielding shorter product life cycles. Traditional modeling and simulation approaches are not suited to handle such scenarios. As a possible solution, we propose a generic data-driven framework for automated generation of simulation models as basis for digital twins for smart factories. The novelty of our proposed framework is in the data-driven approach that exploits advancements in machine learning and process mining techniques, as well as continuous model improvement and validation. The goal of the framework is to minimize and fully define, or even eliminate, the need for expert knowledge in the extraction of the corresponding simulation models. We illustrate our framework through a case study. © 2021 The Author(s)",2022,Data mining E-learning Energy utilization Life cycle Manufacture Real time systems % reductions Data driven Energy-consumption Increased productivity Process mining Real- time Reconfigurable manufacturing Simulation model Smart factory Smart manufacturing Machine learningData-driven Digital twin Machine learning Process mining Reconfigurable manufacturing Smart factory,academic,"Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Campusvej 55, Odense, 5230, Denmark; DTU Compute, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, 2800, Denmark; Department of Computer Science, Information Systems and Engineering, California University of Pennsylvania, California, 15419, PA, United States",235,0.2857142857142857
The Digital Twin Model of Chemical Production Systems in Smart Factories: A Case Study,"Nowadays, more and more information technology such as internet-of-things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) are applied to all walks of life. Facing the pressure of technological innovation, traditional manufacturers have paid attention to digital twin to improve production lines. However, most of the research on digital twin have not implement the concept of digital twin into actual production lines. To fill this gap, this paper demonstrates a digital twin application case study with whole process analysis based on machine learning. More specifically, data preprocessing, clustering, classification and regression are utilized to build a digital twin model. Moreover, we deploy digital twin model to cloud server and develop web application with real-time diagnosis function which has user-friendly interactive interface.

Digital twin for smart manufacturing: a review of concepts towards a practical industrial implementation,"Latest trends and developments in digital technologies have enabled a new manufacturing model. Digital systems can monitor, optimize and control processes by creating a virtual copy of the physical world and making decentralized decisions. This paradigm relies on the development of a digital counterpart, the Digital Twin, for each production resource taking part to the whole manufacturing process.

Automated Model Transformation in modeling Digital Twins of Industrial Internet-of-Things Applications utilizing AutomationML,"In recent years, the manufacturing industry sector has undergone major changes. Better known by the term Industry 4.0, this trend describes the transformation of centrally managed production systems towards decentralized value creation networks. As this leads to a strong increase regarding complexity, engineering such current or future manufacturing systems becomes a difficult task. An example for such a challenging engineering process is the selection of technical implementations fulfilling all requirements and performing the needed functions. In order to support this process, model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and its expressions like model-driven architecture (MDA) proved to be promising approaches. However, semi or fully automated model transformations, which could deal with the aforementioned issue, are still yet widely unexplored in the industrial area. Therefore, this paper introduces an approach transforming the logical architecture of a system into its technical implementation by utilizing AutomationML. As the goal is to perform this step automatically, additional tool support is provided by developing specific software. The results of this approach are thereby evaluated by a real-world case study, which is applied according to the concepts of the Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). © 2021 IEEE.",2021,Internet of things Manufacture Network architecture Software design Systems engineering Architecture modeling Automated model transformations AutomationML Industrial internet of thing Model driven architectures Model-based system engineering Model-based system engineerings Model-driven architecture Reference architecture Reference architecture model industrie 4.0 Software architectureAutomationML Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) Model-driven Architecture (MDA) Reference Architecture Model Industrie 4.0 (RAMI 4.0),academic,"Josef Ressel Center For Dependable System-of-Systems Engineering, Urstein Sued 1, Puch/Salzburg, A-5412, Austria; Siemens Technology, Otto-Hahn-Ring 6, Munich, 81739, Germany; Siemens Technology, Guenther-Scharowsky-Str. 1, Erlangen, 91058, Germany; Otto-v.-Guericke University, Universitatsplatz 2, Magdeburg, D-39106, Germany",238,0.23728813559322035
Unifying digital twin framework: Simulation-based proof-of-concept,"In recent years, the Digital Twin (DT) concept has surfaced in many areas and landed the approach in top strategic technology trends. However, there seems to be no unique understanding of the concept, and debates about what is a DT are leading to ambiguity on the concrete solution to be developed in a given situation. This paper introduces a unifying reference framework, to both serve as a conceptual basis that disambiguates the concept and a guide to derive custom solutions. It is a technology-agnostic three-layered model, which reconciles existing understandings of DT under a common umbrella. We also derive an operational architecture as a possible implementation of the framework, which we demonstrate on two use cases. The large adoption of such a framework will draw a clear line between what is a DT and what is not, while establishing a high-level standard model for DT engineering. © 2021 The Authors.

Explainable Modeling in Digital Twin,"Stakeholders' participation in the modeling process is important to successful Digital Twin (DT) implementation. The key question in the modeling process is to decide which options to include. Explaining the key question clearly ensures the organizations and end-users know what the digital models in DT are capable of. To support successful DT implementation, we propose a framework of explainable modeling to enable the collaboration and interaction between modelers and stakeholders. We formulate the modeling process mathematically and develop three types of automatically generated explanations to support understanding and build trust. We introduce three explainability scores to measure the value of explainable modeling. We illustrate how the proposed explainable modeling works by a case study on developing and implementing a DT factory. The explainable modeling increases communication efficiency and builds trust by clearly expressing the model competencies, answering key questions in modeling automatically, and enabling consistent understanding of the model.  © 2021 IEEE.",2021,Automatically generated Case-studies Communication efficiency Digital modeling End-users Modeling process Stakeholder participation,academic,"Tsinghua University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Beijing, 100084, China; University of California, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Berkeley, 94720, CA, United States",244,0.3333333333333333
Using automationml and graph-based design languages for automatic generation of digital twins of cyber-physical systems,"The interdisciplinary development of smart factories and cyber-physical systems CPS shows the weaknesses of classical development methods. For example, the communication of the interdisciplinary participants in the development process of CPS is difficult due to a lack of cross-domain language comprehension. At the same time, the functional complexity of the systems to be developed increases and they act operationally as independent CPSs. And it is not only the product that needs to be developed, but also the manufacturing processes are complex. The use of graph-based design languages offers a technical solution to these challenges. The UML-based structures offer a cross-domain language understanding for all those involved in the interdisciplinary development process. Simulations are required for the rapid and successful development of new products. Depending on the functional scope, graphical simulations of the production equipment are used to simulate the manufacturing processes as a digital factory or a virtual commissioning simulation. Due to the high number of functional changes during the development process, it makes sense to automatically generate the simulation modelling as digital twins of the products or means of production from the graph-based design languages. The paper describes how digital twins are automatically generated using AutomationML according to the Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) or the Industrial Internet Reference Architecture (IIRA). © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.",2020,Computer simulation languages Cyber Physical System Embedded systems Graphic methods Manufacture Modeling languages Product design Automatic Generation Automatically generated Functional complexity Manufacturing process Means of productions Production equipments Reference architecture Virtual commissioning Digital twinAutomationML Crossdomain Engineering Digital Twin Graph-based Design Languages RAMI 4.0,academic,"Albstadt-Sigmaringen University, Albstadt, Germany; CMC-Kiesel GmbH, Hechingen, Germany",244,0.2558139534883721
Towards developing multiscale-multiphysics models and their surrogates for digital twins of metal additive manufacturing,"Artificial intelligence (AI) embedded within digital models of manufacturing processes can be used to improve process productivity and product quality significantly. The application of such advanced capabilities particularly to highly digitalized processes such as metal additive manufacturing (AM) is likely to make those processes commercially more attractive. AI capabilities will reside within Digital Twins (DTs) which are living virtual replicas of the physical processes. DTs will be empowered to operate autonomously in a diagnostic control capacity to supervise processes and can be interrogated by the practitioner to inform the optimal processing route for any given product. The utility of the information gained from the DTs would depend on the quality of the digital models and, more importantly, their faster-solving surrogates which dwell within DTs for consultation during rapid decision-making. In this article, we point out the exceptional value of DTs in AM and focus on the need to create high-fidelity multiscale-multiphysics models for AM processes to feed the AI capabilities. We identify technical hurdles for their development, including those arising from the multiscale and multiphysics characteristics of the models, the difficulties in linking models of the subprocesses across scales and physics, and the scarcity of experimental data. We discuss the need for creating surrogate models using machine learning approaches for real-time problem-solving. We further identify non-technical barriers, such as the need for standardization and difficulties in collaborating across different types of institutions. We offer potential solutions for all these challenges, after reflecting on and researching discussions held at an international symposium on the subject in 2019. We argue that a collaborative approach can not only help accelerate their development compared with disparate efforts, but also enhance the quality of the models by allowing modular development and linkages that account for interactions between the various sub-processes in AM. A high-level roadmap is suggested for starting such a collaboration. © 2021 The Authors",2021,Additives Decision making Industry 4.0 Machine learning Problem solving Digital modeling Machine-learning Manufacturing IS Manufacturing process Metal additives Multi-physics modeling Multiscale models Process productivity Process products Products quality 3D printersAdditive manufacturing Artificial intelligence Digital twins Industry 4.0 Machine learning Multiphysics modeling Multiscale modeling,academic,"CSIRO Manufacturing, Private Bag 10, Clayton, 3169, VIC, Australia; CSIRO Manufacturing, PO Box 218, Lindfield, 2070, NSW, Australia; School of Computing, Australian National University, Acton, 2601, ACT, Australia; Department of Materials Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, 16802, PA, United States; Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, 7000 East Avenue, Livermore, 94550, CA, United States; Ira A.

Robust additive manufacturing performance through a control oriented digital twin,"The additive manufacturing process control utilizing digital twins is an emerging issue. However, robustness in process performance is still an open aspect, due to uncertainties, e.g., in material properties. To this end, in this work, a digital twin offering uncertainty management and robust process control is designed and implemented. As a process control design method, the Linear Matrix Inequalities are adopted. Within specific uncertainty limits, the performance of the process is proven to be acceptably constant, thus achieving robust additive manufacturing. Variations of the control law are also investigated, in order for the applicability of the control to be demonstrated in different machine architectures. The comparison of proposed controllers is done against a fine-tuned conventional proportional–integral–derivative (PID) and the initial open-loop model for metals manufacturing. As expected, the robust control design achieved a 68% faster response in the settling time metric, while a well-calibrated PID only achieved 38% compared to the initial model. © 2021 by the authors.

Building a digital twin for additive manufacturing through the exploitation of blockchain: A case analysis of the aircraft industry,"Blockchain is becoming a widespread digital technology that allows every transaction to be tracked in an inviolable way, hence making it possible to go back through the entire history of products and product components. Its idiosyncratic characteristics can be especially useful in the aircraft industry, a highly technologically-based sector, wherein manufacturers of components are governed by stringent technical standards, the aim of which is to certify and monitor the whole component production process. In addition, the sector makes significant use of additive manufacturing technologies to perform the rapid prototyping of product components, realized through the supply chain, hence reducing time-to-market, while ensuring quality and containing costs. Starting from these premises, the paper focuses on the phases characterizing the metal additive manufacturing process, in which a component for the aircraft industry can be produced and proposes a digital twin for additive manufacturing in the aircraft industry through the exploitation of Blockchain solutions. In doing so, the paper provides a conceptual answer to securing and organizing the data generated through an end-to-end additive manufacturing process in the aircraft industry and underlines how companies exploiting Blockchain can build secure and connected manufacturing infrastructure. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019,3D printers Additives Aircraft Supply chains Additive manufacturing process Additive manufacturing technology Aircraft industries Digital technologies Digital twin Manufacturing infrastructure Production process Technical standards BlockchainAdditive manufacturing Aircraft industry Blockchain Digital technology Digital twin,academic,"Polytechnic University of Bari, Department of Mechanics, Mathematics, and Management, Viale Japigia 182, Bari, 70126, Italy; LIUC Università Cattaneo, School of Industrial Engineering, Corso G.

A digital twin-enhanced system for engineering product family design and optimization,"Engineering product family design and optimization in complex environments has been a major bottleneck in today's industrial transformation towards smart manufacturing. Digital twin (DT), as a core part of cyber-physical system (CPS), can provide decision support to enhance engineering product lifecycle management workflows via remote monitoring and control, high-fidelity simulation, and solution generation functionalities. Although many studies have proven DT to be highly suited for industry needs, little has been reported on the product family design and optimization capabilities specifically with context awareness, which could be leaving many enterprises ambivalent on its adoption. To fill this gap, a reusable and transparent DT capable of situational recognition and self-correction is essentially required. This paper develops a generic DT architecture reference model to enable the context-aware product family design optimization process in a cost-effective manner. A case study featuring asset re-/configuration within a dynamic environment is further described to demonstrate its in-context decision-aiding capabilities.

Decision support in productive processes through DES and ABS in the Digital Twin era: a systematic literature review,"The use of simulation to support decision-making in productive processes (goods and services) is already an established research field. However, with the availability of solutions and technologies, simulation is no longer a tool with limited scope and analysis. In this case, the integration of simulation with physical systems is considered to allow virtual models to be sensitive to physical changes and aligned with the current state of processes, forming the so-called Digital Twin. Therefore, the main purpose of this article is to present a systematic literature review of the use of simulation as Digital Twin to support decision-making. We considered studies published in scientific journals and conference proceedings that include the use of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and/or Agent-Based Simulation (ABS).

Decision-making in a fast fashion company in the Industry 4.0 era: a Digital Twin proposal to support operational planning,"This work explores the improvement of operational decision-making in a Fast Fashion manufacturing company, considering the Industry 4.0 era. The segment requires agile and flexible decision-making techniques to guarantee the companies survival in a high variety environment of products and demand. The proposed approach was based on three stages. First, we suggested changes and improvements in the system to adapt it to the Industry 4.0 principles. Then, we proposed a Digital Twin (DT) focused on operational resource planning (physical and human). The DT was composed of a Discrete Event Simulation model, an Artificial Intelligence model, and a decision dashboard that provides a user-friendly interface for the decision-maker. Finally, the last stage corresponds to cyclical and constant DT-based decision-making. The DT-based decisions helped to decrease the number of operators in the line reducing their idleness and, at the same time, the total lead time became shorter.

The digital twin of the business process model,"In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of organizational management based on high-precision simulation models designed for numerical forecasting of the parameters of business process models - duration, labor intensity and resource intensity, cost. The solution is implemented as a prototype twin of the business process system model. To solve the problem of predicting the numerical indicators of a business process model, the formula and algorithmic apparatus of stochastic GERT networks is used. BPMS ELMA was used as a technical platform for the implementation of a digital twin prototype. To solve this problem, the apparatus of stochastic GERT networks is used. An edge of the GERT network is associated with the operation of the business process, and the node of the GERT network with an event or gateway of the business process. An algorithm for translating a model of a business process into an equivalent GERT network, as well as calculating the parameters of the law of distribution of the cost of a business process based on the obtained GERT network, is given. The proposed tool, implemented in the digital twin modeling module, allows solving the problems of predicting the dynamics of discrete-event models described in BPMN notation without using statistical simulation models. Continuous updating of the structure of the GERT-model in accordance with the modification of the process in the ELMA system and clarification of the parameters of probabilities, the type of distribution laws and their parameters based on the accumulated data of the digital shadow of the business process allows us to talk about the implementation of a high-precision forecasting model of the business process in the proposed digital twin model. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2020,Costs Critical path analysis Digital twin Forecasting Gateways (computer networks) Probability distributions Stochastic models Stochastic systems Business process model Continuous updating Discrete event models Forecasting modeling Law of distribution Numerical forecasting Organizational management Statistical simulation Discrete event simulation,academic,"Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science and Technology, ""Krasnoyarsky rabochy""avenue 31, Krasnoyarsk, Russian Federation",257,0.3684210526315789
A decision support tool for operational planning: a Digital Twin using simulation and forecasting methods,"Paper aims: Propose a continuous decision support system, a Digital Twin, integrating two widely used techniques, Discrete Event Simulation and forecasting methods. Originality: With the evolution of the industry, there is a growing need for increasingly agile and assertive decision support systems. Also, familiar tools and techniques tend to change over time to suit such a scenario, supporting new researches on their use in the modern industry. Research method: The proposed method allows the use of simulation, with the aid of forecasting methods, for continuous decision making, composing the so-called Digital Twin. The method was applied in a real process to validate it. Main findings: The Moving Average, Single Exponential Smoothing, and Double Exponential Smoothing forecasting methods were used to supply the simulation model in order to test scenarios and guide decision making. The developed system enabled a virtual copy with a certain degree of intelligence and that provides answers to make the constant decision-making process more efficient. Implications for theory and practice: The proposed method can be used for several operational problems like headcount, production planning and covers different levels of decision.

Representing financial data streams in digital simulations to support data flow design for a future Digital Twin,"Discrete Event Simulations may be used to forecast detailed production system behaviour under future conditions and support better informed decision making. However, data beyond production metrics, e.g. financial information, is also necessary for most significant decisions. Herein a modelling approach is proposed and demonstrated based on simulating both production and financial transactions. The contribution of this paper is to represent the base production events as well as additional events which trigger financial transactions. The method is demonstrated for an idealised production business, employing Discrete Event Simulation and examining the impact of system labour arrangements on the business cash flow with a variable demand based on a normal probability distribution function (with distinct means and variances for each product). Based on the financial transactions a representation of a detail commercial scenario may be modelled alongside the production events. The presented studies identify the potential sensitivity of analysis to the volume and timing of transactions on accumulated accounting metrics such as profit. Additionally the paper illustrates how such a modelling approach can be used to characterise the system and assess specific control strategies when both production and finance data streams are available. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,Decision making Discrete event simulation Distribution functions Sensitivity analysis Financial information Financial metrics Financial transactions Normal probability distributions Production business Production demand Real-time forecasting Resource planning FinanceDiscrete Event Simulation Factory Digital Twin Financial metrics Industrial Internet of Things Labour resource planning Production demand Real time forecasting,academic,"School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Queen's University Belfast, Ashby Building, Belfast, BT9 5AH, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom; N.I.

Defining Production and Financial Data Streams Required for a Factory Digital Twin to Optimise the Deployment of Labour,With the emergence of capable and low cost sensing hardware simulations may be driven from real time production data. Such simulation could be used to predict future system performance. However for effective decision making knowledge of system level behaviour beyond production e.g. financial metrics would also be required. The generation of standard accounting data from simulation models has received little attention in the literature.

Digital twin framework for reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs): design and simulation,"Faced with the global crisis of COVID-19 and the strong increase in customer demands, competition is becoming more intense between companies, on the one hand, and supply chains on the other. This competition has led to the development of new strategies to manage demand and increase market share. Among these strategies are the growing interest in sustainable manufacturing and the need for customizable products that create an increasingly complex manufacturing environment. Sustainable manufacturing and the need for customizable products create an environment of increased competition and constant change. Indeed, companies are trying to establish more flexible and agile manufacturing systems through several systems of reconfiguration. Reconfiguration contributes to an extension of the manufacturing system’s life cycle by modifying its physical, organizational and IT characteristics according to the changing market conditions. Due to the rapid development of new information technology (such as IoT, Big Data analytics, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing and artificial intelligence), digital twins have become intensively used in smart manufacturing.

Generic framework for developing process digital twin applicable to high value-added manufacturing,"Our team has developed a generic modular framework to create Process Digital Twin (PDT) that can be customized for any process. Elements of this framework are (i) configuration of manufacturing process inputs as seen by user, (ii) capturing variation of manufacturing inputs (iii) build accurate and fast multi-parametric numerical solution using advanced model order reduction (MOR) techniques, (iv) Extract features for quality (FFQ) using specialized algorithms and (v) predict probability of success from quality models and (vi) capability to receive post-production process and quality data and use machine learning algorithms to automatically update various models. Irrespective of the physical and geometrical complexity of individual process, our numerical techniques assure a real time (< 10 sec) multi-parametric solution. Primary output of process digital twin (PDT) is predicting probability of success of a process based on all manufacturing inputs both material and physical. This allows us to use PDT to maximize production success by adjusting controllable inputs apriori.

Reconfigurable manufacturing systems characteristics in digital twin context,"The concept of a reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) has been introduced to enable production systems to continuously evolve and respond rapidly to unpredicted and fluctuating market environments. To achieve this goal, RMS needs to exhibit six core characteristics: modularity, integrability, scalability, diagnosability, convertibility and customisation. These characteristics are required to ensure manufacturing systems' resilience while maintaining productivity and quality. Assessing these characteristics at both the design and operating phase can be aided by the digital twinning (DT) of physical systems. To this end, the DT-RMS concept is introduced in this paper as a dynamic cyber-replica of the physical production environment, enabling a high-level of transparency about data, performance, and relevant reconfiguration decisions. As a result, DT-RMS responds to the need to integrate requirements and performance targets for the RMS characteristics at design and operating-time.

A digital twin emulator of a modular production system using a data-driven hybrid modeling and simulation approach,"Virtual commissioning is a key technology in Industry 4.0 that can address issues faced by engineers during early design phases. The process of virtual commissioning involves the creation of a Digital Twin—a dynamic, virtual representation of a corresponding physical system. The digital twin model can be used for testing and verifying the control system in a simulated virtual environment to achieve rapid set-up and optimization prior to physical commissioning. Additionally, the modular production control systems, can be integrated and tested during or prior to the construction of the physical system. This paper describes the implementation of a digital twin emulator of an automated mechatronic modular production system that is linked with the running programmable logic controllers and allow for exchanging near real-time information with the physical system. The development and deployment of the digital twin emulator involves a novel hybrid simulation- and data-driven modeling approach that combines Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Modeling paradigms.

Modelling cycle for simulation digital twins,Digital twins (DT) form part of the Industry 4.0 revolution within manufacturing and related industries. A DT is a digital model (DM) of a real system that features continuous and automated synchronisation and feedback of optimisations between the real and digital domains. A core technology for predictive capabilities from DT is discrete event simulation (DES). The modelling cycle for developing and analysing DES models is significantly different compared to DM.

Mixed discrete-continuous simulation for digital Twins,"The advent of Digital Twins has precipitated the need for an open and flexible simulation framework with unique design considerations. A key requirement of such a framework is the ability to simulate systems containing a mix of discrete and continuous processes that may interact with each other. In this paper, we propose a framework for mixed discrete-continuous simulations particularly targeted for Digital Twin applications. The framework is based on SimPy, a popular discrete-event simulation library in Python. We first present a systematic approach by which continuous process simulations can be integrated within the event-stepped engine of SimPy. We illustrate the approach using an example.

How to model and implement connections between physical and virtual models for digital twin application,"Digital twin (DT) is a virtual mirror (representation) of a physical world or a system along its lifecycle. As for a complex discrete manufacturing system (DMS), it is a digital model for emulating or reproducing the functions or actions of a real manufacturing system by giving the system simulation information or directly driven by a real system with proper connections between the DT model and the real-world system. It is a key building block for smart factory and manufacturing under the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The key research question is how to effectively create a DT model during the design stage of a complex manufacturing system and to make it usable throughout the system's lifecycle such as the production stage. Given that there are some existing discussions on DT framework development, this paper focuses on the modeling methods for rapidly creating a virtual model and the connection implementation mechanism between a physical world production system at a workshop level and its mirrored virtual model. To reach above goals, in this paper, the discrete event system (DES) modeling theory is applied to the three-dimension DT model. First, for formally representing a manufacturing system and creating its virtual model, seven basic elements: controller, executor, processor, buffer, flowing entity, virtual service node and logistics path of a DMS have been identified and the concept of the logistics path network and the service cell is introduced to uniformly describe a manufacturing system. Second, for implementing interconnection and interaction, a new interconnection and data interaction mechanism between the physical system and its virtual model for through-life applications has been designed. With them, each service cell consists of seven elements and encapsulates input/output information and control logic. All the discrete cells are constructed and mapped onto different production-process-oriented digital manufacturing modules by integrating logical, geometric and data models. As a result, the virtual-physical connection is realized to form a DT model. The proposed virtual modeling method and the associated connection mechanism have been applied to a real-world workshop DT to demonstrate its practicality and usefulness. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2021,Complex networks Digital twin Industrial research Life cycle Manufacture Complex manufacturing systems Digital manufacturing Discrete manufacturing systems Framework development Implementation mechanisms Physical connections Research questions System simulations Discrete event simulationCyber-physical system Digital twin Discrete event system modeling theory Virtual-physical connection,academic,"Institute of Advanced Design and Manufacturing, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, 610031, China; School of Design, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 8ST, United Kingdom",286,0.3

Structured Development of Digital Twins—A Cross-Domain Analysis towards a Unified Approach,"Digital Twins (DT) as digital representations are increasingly becoming operational design tools in a variety of contexts. Although a common understanding of the concept and the underlying development procedure would facilitate DT applications, only limited information has been published on the essential stages of development and fundamental development activities. This paper examines the extent to which an abstract, and thus generally applicable model for the development of Digital Twins can be identified. In order to come up with such a reference procedure, a structured analysis of published development experiences has been performed. Three major application domains, namely product lifecycle management, manufacturing, and predictive maintenance, could be detailed and cross-checked. For each of these domains, a contextual development model could be derived from empirically valid design and engineering practices. The data also allowed for the determination of which way each model corresponds to existing Digital Twin concepts. The use of a standard modeling notation enabled the integration of the domain-specific models into a single Digital Twin development model. As a result, developers are guided by domain-independent and -dependent development steps. Due to its generic structure, the model can serve for further domain explorations. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,digital twin process analysis process modeling reference modeling,academic,"Business Informatics-Communications Engineering, Business School, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, 4040, Austria",291,0.5

Realizing A Digital Twin of An Organization Using Action-oriented Process Mining,"A Digital Twin of an Organization (DTO) is a mirrored representation of an organization, aiming to improve the business process of the organization by providing a transparent view over the process and automating management actions to deal with existing and potential risks. Unlike wide applications of digital twins to product design and predictive maintenance, no concrete realizations of DTOs for business process improvement have been studied. In this work, we aim to realize DTOs using action-oriented process mining, a collection of techniques to evaluate violations of constraints and produce the required actions. To this end, we suggest a digital twin interface model as a transparent representation of an organization describing the current state of business processes and possible configurations in underlying information systems. By interacting with the representation, process analysts can elicit constraints and actions that will be continuously monitored and triggered by an action engine to improve business processes.

A Data-driven Digital Twin of CNC Machining Processes for Predicting Surface Roughness,"Digital Twin of a CNC machining process can enhance process optimisation at process planning stage and machining stage.

Towards a digital twin for thermal processes: Control-centric approach,"Manufacturing processes modelling can be complicated, since processes are in their majority spatially distributed systems. The case of thermal processes such as laser processes is also in this category. Furthermore, specific issues that increase this complexity can be non-linearities (in particular phase change).

Thus, the Processes are much easier to be controlled through optimal / adaptive / robust controllers.

Digital twin-driven multi-variable process control of thermal manufacturing processes,"Thermal manufacturing processes are complicated to the extent that they require sophisticated performance optimization. However, their implemented form often lacks advanced control strategies. This research proposes digital twins (DTs) that generalize the concept of process control towards multivariable performance optimization. To achieve this, data-driven models are used to describe the mathematical link between the process parameters and the performance indicators (KPIs), while they are all defined based on the spatiotemporal profile of the temperature field. The control strategy is then designed based on time and quality criteria, while the control enforcement is regarded in real-time manner, so that the DT concept is validated. The performance of the process models is examined through aggregation of modelling details from physics-based models from an LPBF process, including delays and dynamics. The current proposed framework seems to close the gap between the theoretical and data driven models with respect to process modelling and control efficiency. © 2022 The Authors.

Introduction of a comprehensive Structure Model for the Digital Twin in Manufacturing,"The discussion about the term ""Digital Twin""and its associated concepts has expanded remarkably in the scientific community in recent years. In the context of industrial production, the Digital Twin refers to a holistic, linked, virtual representation of a physical entity. The spectrum of these entities ranges from individual products to specific manufacturing processes up to complex automated production systems. Due to this diversity, many authors offer different interpretations of the topic, resulting in a wide range of use case-specific models. However, a common meta-model that integrates and classifies the different aspects is still to be presented. Starting with a brief overview of developments in recent years, this paper introduces a novel Digital Twin Structure Model in the context of manufacturing.

A Requirements Driven Digital Twin Framework: Specification and Opportunities,"Among the tenets of Smart Manufacturing (SM) or Industry 4.0 (I4.0), digital twin (DT), which represents the capabilities of virtual representations of components and systems, has been cited as the biggest technology trend disrupting engineering and design today. DTs have been in use for years in areas such as model-based process control and predictive maintenance, however moving forward a framework is needed that will support the expected pervasiveness of DT technology in the evolution of SM or I4.0. A set of requirements for a DT framework has been derived from analysis of DT definitions, DTs in use today, expected DT applications in the near future, and longer-term DT trends and the DT vision in SM. These requirements include elements of re-usability, interoperability, interchangeability, maintainability, extensibility, and autonomy across the entire DT lifecycle. A baseline framework for DT technology has been developed that addresses many aspects of these requirements and enables the addressing of the requirements more fully through additional specification. The baseline framework includes a definition of a DT and an object-oriented (O-O) architecture for DTs that defines generalization, aggregation and instantiation of DT classes. Case studies using and extending the baseline framework illustrate its advantages in supporting DT solutions and trends in SM. © 2013 IEEE.",2020,Life cycle Specifications Case-studies Model based process control Object oriented Smart manufacturing Technology trends Virtual representations Digital twinDigital twin industry 40 modeling prediction smart manufacturing,academic,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, 48109, MI, United States",308,0.2

Contribution to the development of a Digital Twin based on product lifecycle to support the manufacturing process,"The current manufacture challenges are closely linked to the aim of digitalizing the product, the process and the means of production. In such aspects, information about the production processes is available in real-time, allowing managers to act on digital models and, through them, apply decisions in real systems. Thus, having a mirror model or a Digital Twin enables real-time absorption, simulation and implementation of manufacturing variations from the real environment, allowing faster detection of physical problems, and faster production response. The Digital Twin is a virtual representation of the physical system, which is equipped with sensors and actuators and feed the digital system, where the monitoring of data and simulation of variations, for instance, take place. From the synchronized interactions of both components, it is possible to deliver the mentioned faster production responses. Brazilian and German universities joined efforts to develop a Digital Twin based on product lifecycle to support the Manufacturing Process to address these challenges. The proposed Digital Twin seeks to integrate the product twin and the twin of its development process. It shall represent the manufacturing process, enabling the monitoring and optimization of the real production process. The Digital Twin itself is addressed as a product inside the production system and, therefore, its development process will follow the product lifecycle perspective, from the conception and planning to its implementation and usage. The Digital Twin will be further improved with the introduction of Artificial Intelligence tools, characterizing a Smart Digital Twin of the Manufacturing Process. Thus, this paper aims to present the concepts of a research project that is being developed in a joint Brazilian-German Cooperative Research. © 2019 The Authors.

A hierarchical integrated modeling method for the digital twin of mechanical products,"With the development of information and communication technology, massive amounts of data are generated during the entire lifecycle of mechanical products. However, their isolated and fragmented state hinders further empowerment of smart manufacturing. Digital twins have attracted considerable attention as they enable a user to rebuild all elements of a physical entity in a virtual space, targeted at the effective fusion of data from multiple sources with different formats, while its modeling method still needs further research. In this context, we propose a native, full-element digital twin modeling method for mechanical products. This ontology-based method establishes a unified and computer-understandable model framework for mechanical products by abstracting the essential content and relationships of data and by storing them in a graph database efficiently. The developed model could serve as a data center for the entire lifecycle of the product or could be combined with existing data management systems, integrating the previously isolated, fragmented, and scattered data on various platforms. In addition, the model utilizes the structural characteristics of mechanical products and is developed as a hierarchical digital mapping to better meet the application requirements. Finally, a case study of a helicopter digital twin is presented to verify the proposed method. © 2021 by the authors.

Conceptual Modeling of Lifecycle Digital Twin Architecture for Bridges: A Data Structure Approach,"The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has emerged in recent years to facilitate the use of Building Information Modeling during the entire projects' lifecycle. In the DT concept, cyber-physical system theory is utilized to collect condition data about an existing asset and then integrate this data into the digital model. The major limitation though is that the current scope of DT is limited to the operation and maintenance phase. Nevertheless, the DT concept can be extended to the entire lifecycle of the asset if the relevant sensory and non-sensory data are incorporated into the digital model in an automated and systematic way. However, in the current literature, there is no clear insight about such a holistic and life-cycle DT concept for infrastructure projects. Especially, there is very little understanding about how various sensory and non-sensory data from construction and operation phases can be seamlessly integrated into the 3D BIM models. Therefore, this research aims to develop a conceptual model for the architecture of Lifecycle DT (LDT) focusing on bridges. To this end, an ontological modeling approach is adopted. The proposed ontology is validated through a workshop session where domain experts assessed the results with respect to some competency questions. The outcome of the session indicated that the proposed ontology scored sufficiently in all the criteria and succeeded in satisfying the information needs of the LDT. Overall, the proposed model offers an insight into a lifecycle modeling practice as well as automated data incorporation, enabling a smooth transition towards an upgraded modeling practice. © 2022 International Association on Automation and Robotics in Construction.",2022,Architectural design Bridges Embedded systems Information theory Ontology Robotics 'current Bridge information modeling Building Information Modelling Conceptual model Digital modeling Information Modeling Lifecycle digital twin Ontological modeling Ontology's Sensory data Life cycleBridge information modelling Digital twin Lifecycle digital twin Ontological modelling,academic,"Department of Construction Management & Engineering, University of Twente, Netherlands",314,0.21951219512195122
Data Evolution Governance for Ontology-based Digital Twin Product Lifecycle Management,"Product life cycle management (PLM) is an effective method for enhancing the market competitiveness of modern manufacturing industries. The digital twin is characterized by a profound integration of physics and information systems, which provides a technical means for integrating multi-source information and breaking the time and space barrier of communication at each link of the life cycle. Currently, however, the application of this technology focuses primarily on the product itself and &#x201C;service-oriented&#x201D; application results. There is a lack of focus on twin data and its internal evolutionary mechanisms separately. In the management of global data resources, the benefits of digital twin technology cannot be fully realized. This paper applies ontology technology in an innovative manner to the field of the digital twin to increase the reusability of twin data.

"Integration of Design, Manufacturing, and Service Based on Digital Twin to Realize Intelligent Manufacturing","Complex product design, manufacturing, and service are the key elements of a product’s life cycle. However, the traditional manufacturing processes of design, manufacturing, and service are independent of each other, so lack deep integration. The emergence of digital twins offers an opportunity to accelerate the integration of complex product design, manufacturing, and services. For intelligent manufacturing, physical entity and virtual entity transformation can be realized through digital information. A collaborative framework for complex product design, manufactur-ing, and service integration based on digital twin technology was proposed. The solutions of process integration, data flow, modeling and simulation, and information fusion were analyzed. The core characteristics and key technologies of service‐oriented manufacturing, design for service and man-ufacturing, and manufacturing monitoring based on the deep integration of the digital twin were discussed. Finally, the feasibility of the framework was verified by a self‐balancing multistage pump manufacturing case. The performance of the upgraded pump under the framework was tested, and the test results proved the effectiveness of the integrated framework. © 2022 by the authors.

Design and Implementation of Digital Twin-Based Application for Global Manufacturing Enterprises,"Nowadays, global competition in the manufacturing sector is increasingly fierce. Thus, global manufacturing companies must have a manufacturing system that ensures the production of reasonably priced, high-quality products, while meeting the needs of various customers. To address this issue, smart manufacturing should be implemented by adopting various information and communication technologies and convergence with existing manufacturing industries. One of the key technologies required for the implementation of smart manufacturing is a cyber-physical system (CPS). One of the major factors for the successful construction of a CPS is digital twin (DT). In this paper, we propose a standards-based information model for building a DT application, which is a key technology of a CPS-based integrated platform, by overcoming the heterogeneous device environment of global manufacturers and using data collected from various manufacturing sites. Furthermore, we propose a concept of modeling and simulation-based DT application. The DT application proposed in this study facilitates monitoring, diagnosis, and prediction at manufacturing sites using real-time data collected from various environments by ensuring interoperability.

Information modeling for cyber-physical production system based on digital twin and AutomationML,"Production systems play an important role in intelligent manufacturing. A large number of manufacturing resources are designed and developed with virtual (digital) ones, which will be associated with the physical ones throughout their lifecycle. With the recent emergence of information and communications technologies (ICTs), such as internet of things, big data, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and 5G, the interconnection and interaction between physical resources and virtual ones become possible in production systems. Digital twin (DT) shows great potential to realize the cyber-physical production system (CPPS) in the era of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we present our vision on integrating various physical resources into CPPS via DT and AutomationML. To elaborate on how to apply ICTs, this paper firstly explores a generic architecture of CPPS based on DT.

Smart shop-floor is one of the basic units of smart manufacturing.

However, it is very important that how to realize the intelligent interconnection and interaction between physical shop-floors and virtual ones.

Predicting the Unpredictable through Realism in Interoperable Digital Twins,"Current Digital Twin solutions provide valuable support to production engineers and product designers in terms of instantaneous feedback on machine performance and simulations of potential product revisions. However, the information provided by these solutions is focused on well understood scenarios from real world situations. Current twins cannot deal with problems that are less well understood.

Production Recipe Validation through Formalization and Digital Twin Generation,"The advent of Industry 4.0 is making production processes every day more complicated. As such, early process validation is becoming crucial to avoid production errors thus decreasing costs. In this paper, we present an approach to validate production recipes.

These specifications are formalized into a hierarchy of assume-guarantee contracts. Each contract specifies a set of temporal behaviors, characterizing the different machines composing the production line, their actions and interaction. Then, the formal specifications provided by the contracts are systematically synthesized to automatically generate a digital twin for the production line. Finally, the digital twin is used to evaluate, and validate, both the functional and the extra-functional characteristics of the system.The methodology has been applied to validate the production of a product requiring additive manufacturing, robotic assembling and transportation. © 2020 EDAA.",2020,Digital twin Formal specification Model checking Robotic assembly AutomationML Functional characteristics Process validation Production line Production plant Production process Temporal behavior ManufactureDesign Automation Digital Twin Simulation and Validation Smart Manufacturing,academic,"University of Verona, Department of Computer Science, Italy; Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore",316,0.26666666666666666

PhysiNet: A combination of physics-based model and neural network model for digital twins,"As the real-time digital counterpart of a physical system or process, digital twins are utilized for system simulation and optimization. Neural networks are one way to build a digital twins model by using data especially when a physics-based model is not accurate or even not available. However, for a newly designed system, it takes time to accumulate enough data for neural network models and only an approximate physics-based model is available.

Data are gathered by machines’ controllers and external sensors to be used for the synchronous tuning of the digital models and their simulation. The outcome of the simulation is then used to assess the resource’s condition and to calculate RUL. In this way, the condition and the status of the machines can be monitored and predicted as a result from the simulation of physics-based models, without invasive techniques of common predictive maintenance solutions.

A Surrogate Model to Predict Production Performance in Digital Twin-Based Smart Manufacturing,"With the dynamic arrival of production orders and unforeseen changes in shop-floor conditions within a production system, production scheduling presents a challenge for manufacturing firms to ensure production demands are met with high productivity and low operating cost. Before a production schedule is generated to process the incoming production orders, production planning is performed. Given the large number of input parameters involved in the production planning, it poses the challenge on how to systematically and accurately predict and evaluate production performance. Hence, it is important to understand the interactions of the input parameters between the production planning and the scheduling. This is to ensure that the production planning and the scheduling are coordinated and can be performed to achieve optimal production performance such as minimizing cost effectively and efficiently. Digital twin presents an opportunity to mirror the real-time production status and analyze the input parameters affecting the production performance in smart manufacturing. In this paper, we propose an approach to develop a surrogate model to predict the production performance using input parameters from a production plan using the capabilities of real-time synchronization of production data in digital twin. Multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) is applied to construct a surrogate model based on three categories of input parameters, i.e., current production system load, machine-based and product-based parameters. An industrial case study involving a wafer fabrication production is used to develop the surrogate model based on a random sampling of varying numbers of training data set. The proposed MARS model shows a high correlation coefficient and a large reduction in the number of input parameters for both linear and nonlinear cases with relation to three performances, namely flowtime, tardiness, and machine utilization.

Toward digital validation for rapid product development based on digital twin: a framework,"Product development should cover product design, validation, and manufacturing. In traditional product development, physical validation based on physical trial manufacturing is the key step to confirm the design scheme before physical manufacturing. However, physical validation is costly and inefficient, which could be the main obstacle to achieving rapid product development. The emergence of digital twin provides an opportunity to accelerate product development by eliminating physical validation toward digital validation in the smart manufacturing era. Therefore, a framework of rapid product development based on digital twin is proposed in this paper. During product development, the new product is designed according to the new requirements in the virtual space, in which the existing digital twins of products can be referenced. Then, an ultrahigh-fidelity virtual manufacturing system is constructed for digital trial manufacturing based on the digital twin of the manufacturing system and the design scheme of the new product. An ultrahigh-fidelity digital prototype can be obtained from digital trial manufacturing for digital validation. The new product validation is executed on the digital prototype to test its performance. The digital validation results can be used to improve the design scheme of the new product and boost the corresponding manufacturing processes. In addition, the core characteristics and key technologies of rapid product development based on digital twin are discussed. Finally, a case study is presented to implement the proposed framework and to show the effectiveness of accelerating product development. © 2021, The Author(s).",2022,Agile manufacturing systems Digital devices Product design Design scheme Design validation Digital prototype Digital validation Manufacturing IS Product manufacturing Product validation Rapid product development Smart manufacturing Traditional products Product developmentDigital twin Digital validation Product development Smart manufacturing,academic,"School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; AVIC Technology Co.

Automated manufacturing system discovery and digital twin generation,"The latest developments in industry involved the deployment of digital twins for both long and short term decision making, such as supply chain management, production planning and control. Modern production environments are frequently subject to disruptions and consequent modifications. As a result, the development of digital twins of manufacturing systems cannot rely solely on manual operations. Recent contributions proposed approaches to exploit data for the automated generation of the models. However, the resulting representations can be excessively accurate and may also describe activities that are not significant for estimating the system performance. Generating models with an appropriate level of detail can avoid useless efforts and long computation times, while allowing for easier understanding and re-usability. This paper proposes a method to automatically discover manufacturing systems and generate adequate digital twins. The relevant characteristics of a production system are automatically retrieved from data logs. The proposed method has been applied on two test cases and a real manufacturing line. The experimental results prove its effectiveness in generating digital models that can correctly estimate the system performance. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2021,Decision making Digital twin Production control Supply chain management Automated generation Automated manufacturing systems Generating models Latest development Manual operations Manufacturing lines Production environments Production planning and control ManufactureDigital twins Industry 4.0 Manufacturing systems Process mining Simulation,academic,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Via La Masa 1, Milan, 20156, Italy",323,0.32432432432432434

A digital twin-based approach for multi-objective optimization of short-term production planning,"Short-term multi-product production planning strongly depends on manifold considerations which can be related to backlog production, product-type prioritization, machine capacity, and set-ups. Different manufacturing systems conditions may lead to different objectives. In this context, it is rather difficult to define a-priori optimal production plans. This paper presents an effective approach for short-term production planning of multi-product systems based on the integration of a Digital Twin and a multi-objective optimization method. The proposed approach has been implemented in a real industrial case of the railway sector. Numerical results show that useful insights can be inferred from the proposed methodology. © 2021 The Authors.

The digital twin as a core component for industry 4.0 smart production planning,"Production systems that adhere the Industry 4.0 vision require new ways of control and integration of individual components, such as robots, transportation system shuttles or mobile platforms. This paper proposes a new production system control concept based on closing a feedback loop between a production planning system and a digital twin of the physical production system. The digital twin keeps up-to-date information about the current state of the physical production system and it is combined with the production planner utilizing artificial intelligence methods. Production recipes and concrete process instantiations are planned for each production order on-the-fly, based on the production system state retrieved form the digital twin. This approach provides a high flexibility in terms of ability to add and to remove products as well as production resources. It also enables error recovery by re-planning the production if some failure happens. The proposed approach is tested and evaluated on an internally hosted Industry 4.0 testbed, which confirms its efficiency and flexibility.

Challenges and potentials of digital twins and industry 4.0 in product design and production for high performance products,"Digital twins offer great opportunities in various domains of the product engineering process. However, current approaches to the use of digital twins only focus on different separated disciplines. In contrast to that, it is expected that the holistic use of digital twin models in product development and production will dominate future product generations, because they allow to create high-performance products competitively. This paper explores important challenges and future potentials of digital twins and Industry 4.0 for the seamless integration of product specification and production. In this regard, approaches of linking digital twins to other domains open up new possibilities in tolerance allocation and production integration. Thereby, the most efficient product specifications in technical and economic terms are achieved for the manufacturer. In addition, the connectivity of Industry 4.0 broadens the scope and enables the evaluation of alternative approaches in production planning and control. Approaches at the organizational level, product functions with specifications beyond the technological limits and production control strategies (e.g. order dispatching) ensure high performance operations. Simulations with a digital production twin with integrated digital product twin allow early estimations even before the actual ramp-up of the product. The future challenge addressed in this paper is to define a consistent framework for the holistic use of digital twins in the entire product development process, which requires the integration of product designers and production planner concepts. © 2019 The Authors.

Building a right digital twin with model engineering,"In recent years, the concept of digital twin (DT) is attracting more and more attention from researchers and engineers. But there is still no consensus on what a right DT is. On one hand, some common models are renamed as DTs. On the other hand, some DTs extremely pursue ‘the same’ as physical objects, which bring unnecessary complexities to them. In this paper, we try to answer two questions from the point of view of model engineering: how to define a right digital twin, and how to build a right digital twin. The concept and related technologies of model engineering are introduced. Some basic principles and a set of metrics for a right DT are given. An evolutionary concurrent modeling method for DT (ECoM4DT) is proposed not only inheriting the theory from classic M&S methods but also highlighting the characteristics of DT compared with traditional models to systemically guide the DT modeling process. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2021,Engineering Industrial engineering Basic principles Common models Concurrent modeling Model engineering Modeling process Physical objects S-method Traditional models Digital twinComplex system Digital twin Model engineering Modeling and simulation,academic,"Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, MA, United States",327,0.32142857142857145

Conceptual digital twin modeling based on an integrated five-dimensional framework and TRIZ function model,"Digital twin represents a fusion of the informational and physical domains, to bridge the material and virtual worlds. Existing methods of digital twin modeling are mainly based on modular representation, which limits guidance of the modeling process. Such methods do not consider the components or operational rules of the digital twin in detail, thereby preventing designers from applying these methods in their fields. With the increasing application of digital twin to various engineering fields, an effective method of modeling a multi-dimensional digital twin at the conceptual level is required. To such an end, this paper presents a method for the conceptual modeling of a digital twin based on a five-dimensional digital twin framework to represent the complex relationship between digital twin objects and their attributes.

Implementation of digital twin for engine block manufacturing processes,"The digital twin (DT) is undergoing an increase in interest from both an academic and industrial perspective. Although many authors proposed and described various frameworks for DT implementation in the manufacturing industry context, there is an absence of real-life implementation studies reported in the available literature. The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate feasibility of the DT implementation under real conditions of a production plant that is specializing in manufacturing of the aluminum components for the automotive industry. The implementation framework of the DT for engine block manufacturing processes consists of three layers: physical layer, virtual layer and information-processing layer. A simulation model was created using the Tecnomatix Plant Simulation (TPS) software. In order to obtain real-time status data of the production line, programmable logic control (PLC) sensors were used for raw data acquisition. To increase production line productivity, the algorithm for bottlenecks detection was developed and implemented into the DT. Despite the fact that the implementation process is still under development and only partial results are presented in this paper, the DT seems to be a prospective real-time optimization tool for the industrial partner. © 2020 by the authors.

The development of the Digital Twins of Exoskeleton-centered workplaces faces the challenge of approaching the manual assembly and logistics processes as performed by hybrid resources: workers wearing Exoskeletons. From here, the coupling of an Exoskeleton to the digital worker and the realization of the Exoskeleton-Worker Digital Twin requires a thorough understanding of the human models and of wearable robotics, especially Exoskeleton design principles.

Automatic generation of a simulation-based digital twin of an industrial process plant,"A Digital Twin (DT) of a production plant is a digital replica of the plant's physical assets which contains the structure and the dynamics of how the devices and process operate. Simulation-based DTs (SBDTs) are those based on online first-principles simulation models. In these systems, model parameter estimation techniques keep an online plant simulator in the same state as the targeted device or process. As a result, non-measured information of the current state of the plant can be obtained from the model. SBDTs can be used for a number of important applications and they have various advantages compared to DTs based on data-driven models. However, wider industrial adoption of SBDTs is hindered by laborious development of their underlying first-principles simulation model as well as by a lack of integrated lifecycle-wide implementation methods and simulation architectures. This paper focuses on applying previously presented methods for reducing implementation effort of SBDTs. Firstly, laborious simulation model development is tackled by applying an automatic model generation method. Secondly, an integrated implementation methodology of a lifecycle-wide online simulation architecture is followed for developing the SBDT. A SBDT of a laboratory-scale process is implemented to demonstrate the proposed method.

Demonstration of an industrial framework for an implementation of a process digital twin,"Digital twins have received a large amount of exposure around what they can offer to industry generating lots of noise, however there are few demonstrations utilizing published architectural frameworks. This has been addressed by investigating industrial publications and reports on what is the minimum essential requirements to form a digital twin and additional desirable features. From this, a generic industrial architectural framework of a digital twin has been established to utilize real-time information from a physical asset forming a monitoring digital twin. This has been expanded to incorporate a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to form a process digital twin utilizing structured information about the process. The framework, including the DES extension, has been validated on a reconfigurable fixture utilizing an established process that has been modelled using Siemens Plant Simulation. This result forms the start of a feedback loop presenting additional value transforming a monitoring digital twin into a process digital twin. This provides a solid foundation for discussion within the industrial community about defining the core functionality required for digital twins.

Refined Simulation Method for Computer-Aided Process Planning Based on Digital Twin Technology,"Simulation technology is widely used in computer-aided process planning (CAPP). The part machining process is simulated in the virtual world, which can predict manufacturing errors and optimize the process plan. Simulation accuracy is the guarantee of process decision-making and optimization. This article focuses on the use of digital twin technology to build a high-fidelity process model, taking the advantage of the integration of multiple systems, in order to achieve the dynamic association of real-time manufacturing data and process models. Making use of the CAPP/MES systems, the surface inspection data of the part is fed back to the CAPP system and associated with the digital twin process model. The wavelet transform method is used to reduce the noise of the high-frequency signal of the detection data, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated to verify the noise reduction effect. The surface topography, after noise reduction, was reconstructed in Matlab. On this basis, the Poisson reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct the high-fidelity process model for the refined simulation of the subsequent processes. Finally, by comparing the two sets of simulation experiments with the real machining results, we found that the simulation results, based on the digital twin model, are more accurate than the traditional simulation method by 58%. © 2022 by the authors.

This molecular variety causes a growing need for a general change of methods as well as mindset in the process development stage, as there are no platform processes available such as those for monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, market competitiveness demands hyper-intensified processes, including accelerated decisions toward batch or continuous operation of dedicated modular plant concepts. This indicates gaps in process comprehension, when operation windows need to be run at the edges of optimization. In this editorial, the authors review and assess potential methods and begin discussing possible solutions throughout the workflow, from process development through piloting to manufacturing operation from their point of view and experience. Especially, the state-of-the-art for modeling in red biotechnology is assessed, clarifying differences and applications of statistical, rigorous physical-chemical based models as well as cost modeling. ""Digital-twins"" are described and efforts vs. benefits for new applications exemplified, including the regulation-demanded QbD (quality by design) and PAT (process analytical technology) approaches towards digitalization or industry 4.0 based on advanced process control strategies. Finally, an analysis of the obstacles and possible solutions for any successful and efficient industrialization of innovative methods from process development, through piloting to manufacturing, results in some recommendations. A central question therefore requires attention: Considering that QbD and PAT have been required by authorities since 2004, can any biologic manufacturing process be approved by the regulatory agencies without being modeled by a ""digital-twin"" as part of the filing documentation?. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,Biologics Continuous bioprocessing Manufacturing Modeling Modular plants Process intensification Sustainability,academic,"Institute for Separation and Process Technology, Clausthal University of Technology, Leibnizstraße 15, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, D-38678, Germany",329,0.4
Digital twins in manufacturing: An assessment of key features,"In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, technological frameworks aim to arrange information and communication technologies into valuable assets to support the management of operations. One of these frameworks is the digital twin, which enables abstractions of a physical resource in the virtual space, allowing for behavior simulations and performance assessments. Consensus regarding which key features manufacturing digital twins should encompass has not yet been reached. This study summarizes a variety of features proposed by recent models in the literature. Four features are identified, followed by expert analyses that assess how valuable they are to the success of implementations. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020,Manufacture Behavior simulation Expert analysis Industrial revolutions Information and Communication Technologies Performance assessment Physical resources Technological framework Virtual spaces Digital twinDigital twin Industry 4.0 Manufacturing process Simulation,academic,"Pontificia Universidade Catolica Do Parana, Imaculada Conceição 1155, Curitiba, 80215-901, Brazil; University of Southern Denmark, Alsion 2, Sønderborg, 6400, Denmark; Federal University of Parana, Francisco Heraclito dos Santos 100, Curitiba, 81530-000, Brazil; Federal University of Technology - Parana, Pato Branco, 85503-390, Brazil",331,0.2222222222222222
A simulation algorithm of a digital twin for manual assembly process,"Digital twin (DT) is one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0 as it is a critical component in driving real-time simulation and decision making in complex systems. The existing scientific literature on Digital twin primarily refers to a product entity or a physical machine but the core concept can be applied to the entire product lifecycle, particularly the assembly process of a complex product system. In addition, majority of existing work focus on the Digital Twins of individual machines on a shop-floor. This paper focuses on aspects the process to build DTs of a production schedule for a complex defence weapon system. The process is inherently high variety and low quantity in a very manual assembly process. This paper consists of three elements. (1) It reviews the current state of art along with the research gap and discusses how DT can become a tool to the manual assembly process. (2) A data-driven simulation algorithm is proposed to model the complex and manual manufacturing process in a generic-reusable way. (3) Finally, an appropriate complex industrial case study is studied to exemplify the proposed framework. Results demonstrate that the production managers can make more informed early decisions that can help bring assembly schedules in check and limit wasteful efforts when disruptions in the supply chain of parts sourced for the assembly occur. © 2020 The Authors.

Synchronization of Industrial Plant and Digital Twin,"Plant simulations can implement a digital twin. The digital twin is a mirror of the physical asset and shows the state of the assets and the processes at any time during production. Assets however change their behavior due to aging, faults and wear over time. If the simulation configuration and parameterization remain the same, the states of the simulation and the physical asset may drift apart. This paper suggests a method that applies optimization techniques to synchronize the states of the digital twin with the physical asset during production time and at the same time supports detecting changes and identifying their source. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,Factory automation Synchronization digital twin Optimization techniques Physical assets Plant simulation Production time simulation Simulation configuration Industrial plantsdigital twin simulation synchronization,academic,"ICT and Automation, Ifak E.V., Magdeburg, Germany; Institute of Automation Engineering (IFAT), Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany",331,0.23809523809523808
Automatic generation of digital twin industrial system from a high level specification,"A framework for the generation of industrial digital twins is presented in the paper. The framework supports industry automated systems preliminary design development, but also supports the following detailed designs implementation and final systems exploitation phases. The main problem is that requirements for first development phases are much more generic than those required for the later phases. The framework faces this problem by avoiding too detailed specifications for the digital twin generated software, but, at the same time, it takes advantage of the specific applications developed for each industrial implementation where that specificities are taken into account: the final control application and the management application. By properly linking both: the more generic digital twin and specific software applications specifically generated for the industry system, the framework may be ready to be used soon at the early development stages, but also may be used for detailed analyses at late booting and maintenance industry system phases. The system has been specialized in industrial transportation and warehouse systems. The paper presents an example of application for this kind of systems. © 2019 The Authors.

Sustainability requirements of digital twin-based systems: A meta systematic literature review,"Sustainable development was defined by the UN in 1987 as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, and this is a core concept in this paper. This work acknowledges the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., economic, social, and environmental, but its focus is on this last one. A digital twin (DT) is frequently described as a physical entity with a virtual counterpart, and the data, connections between the two, implying the existence of connectors and blocks for efficient and effective data communication. This paper provides a meta systematic literature review (SLR) (i.e., an SLR of SLRs) regarding the sustainability requirements of DT-based systems. Numerous papers on the subject of DT were also selected because they cited the analyzed SLRs and were considered relevant to the purposes of this research. From the selection and analysis of 29 papers, several limitations and challenges were identified: the perceived benefits of DTs are not clearly understood; DTs across the product life cycle or the DT life cycle are not sufficiently studied; it is not clear how DTs can contribute to reducing costs or supporting decision-making; technical implementation of DTs must be improved and better integrated in the context of the IoT; the level of fidelity of DTs is not entirely evaluated in terms of their parameters, accuracy, and level of abstraction; and the ownership of data stored within DTs should be better understood. Furthermore, from our research, it was not possible to find a paper discussing DTs only in regard to environmental sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

Edge-based Digital Twin to trace and ensure sustainability in cross-company production networks,"Manufacturing companies aim at ensuring ecological sustainability within their value-adding processes and sustainability indicators like CO2 emissions associated to a product are becoming important selling points for customers. In consequence, manufacturers investigate and measure their manufacturing processes in order to be able to provide respective numbers, which is however hampered if products are the result of cross-company production networks: Firstly, suppliers have a high understanding of their own processes which is required for an evaluation of the respective sustainability, but are often hesitant to publish this data. In addition, digital models that allow to quantify sustainability indicators require significant data exchanges. The goal of this paper is to describe a concept for an edge-based Digital Twin for the assessment of ecological sustainability in cross-company production networks. By directly computing sustainability indicators at the place of their origin, only a minimum amount of data is being transmitted. This enables to trace the sustainability of a manufactured product while not requiring suppliers to publish sensitive data or domain knowledge. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

"Big data driven Hierarchical Digital Twin Predictive Remanufacturing paradigm: Architecture, control mechanism, application scenario and benefits","Remanufacturing is deemed to be an effective method for recycling resources, achieving sustainable production. However, little importance of remanufacturing has been attached in PLM. Surely, there are many problems in implementation of the remanufacturing strategy, such as inability to effectively reduce uncertainty, lack of product multi-life-cycle remanufacturing process tracking management, lack of smart enabling technology application in the full lifecycle that focusing on multi-life-cycle remanufacturing. After analyzing the reasons, through integrating smart enabling technologies, a new PLM paradigm focusing on the multi-life-cycle remanufacturing process: Big Data driven Hierarchical Digital Twin Predictive Remanufacturing (BDHDTPREMfg) is proposed. And the definition of BDHDTPREMfg is proposed. A big data driven layered architecture and the hierarchical CPS-Digital-Twin(CPSDT) reconfiguration control mechanism of BDHDTPREMfg are respectively developed. Then, this paper presents an application scenario of BDHDTPREMfg to validate the feasibility and effectiveness. Based on the above application analysis, the benefits of penetrating BDHDTPREMfg into the entire lifecycle are demonstrated. The summary of this paper and future research work is discussed in the end. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,Big data Sustainable development CPS-Digital-twin(CPSDT) Enabling technologies multi-life-cycle remanufacturing Reconfiguration Reconfiguration control Remanufacturing process Sustainable production Sustainable products Life cycleBig data CPS-Digital-twin(CPSDT) IoT-cloud multi-life-cycle remanufacturing Reconfiguration Sustainable products,academic,"State Key Laboratory of Mechanical Transmission, Chongqing University, Chongqing, 400044, China; Changan Ford Automobile Co, Chongqing, 401120, China; State Key Laboratory of Complex Product Intelligent Manufacturing System Technology, China Aerospace Science & Industry Corp, Beijing, 100854, China",343,0.2857142857142857
"A framework for digital twin driven product recycle, disassembly and reassembly","Remanufacturing plays an important role in promoting sustainable production. Novel models and methods have been proposed to optimize the key phases of remanufacturing, such as recycling decision-making, disassembly control, parts classification, and reassembly management. However, the implementation of product remanufacturing still faces some challenges: 1) uncertain features of recycling increasing complexity of remanufacturing, 2) difficulty of physical disassembly, 3) imprecise quality classification of returned products, and 4) exceptions existing in remanufacturing processes. As the development of advanced information technologies (e.g. internet of things) and simulation technologies, digital twin was proposed and gained wide attention. By digital twin technologies, the behaviors of physical entities can be monitored, simulated and validated in virtual space to facilitate optimizing the physical activities and making informed decisions. In this paper, a framework for digital twin driven product recycle, disassembly and reassembly was proposed to optimize product remanufacturing processes. Within the proposed framework, real-time management and optimization of remanufacturing processes can be achieved. A proof-of-concept case was used to illustrate the potential future application mode of proposed framework. © 2018, Curran Associates Inc.
