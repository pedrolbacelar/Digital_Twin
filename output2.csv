Product family design and optimization: A digital twin-enhanced approach,"Complex product family design and optimization has been a major challenge in today's mass customization paradigm. Nevertheless, there is still no context-aware testbed to support it. Digital twin, as an emerging concept empowered by the cutting-edge information and communication technology, has been widely adopted to realize smart product-service systems across many sectors. Owing to its advantages of high-fidelity simulation and cyber-physical interconnectivity, a generic digital twin-driven approach is proposed to support the in-context virtual prototyping and usage condition monitoring of complex product family. A case study of tower crane family design and optimization is further exploited to validate its cost-effectiveness. © 2020 The Authors.",2020,Condition monitoring Cost effectiveness Manufacture Product design Service industry Complex products Cyber physicals Design and optimization High-fidelity simulations Interconnectivity Mass customization Product family design Smart products Digital twinDesign optimization Digital twin Product family design Servitization,academic,"Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong; School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore",327,0.2
Decision support in productive processes through DES and ABS in the Digital Twin era: a systematic literature review,"The use of simulation to support decision-making in productive processes (goods and services) is already an established research field. However, with the availability of solutions and technologies, simulation is no longer a tool with limited scope and analysis. In this case, the integration of simulation with physical systems is considered to allow virtual models to be sensitive to physical changes and aligned with the current state of processes, forming the so-called Digital Twin. Therefore, the main purpose of this article is to present a systematic literature review of the use of simulation as Digital Twin to support decision-making. We considered studies published in scientific journals and conference proceedings that include the use of Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and/or Agent-Based Simulation (ABS). Although the Digital Twin concept has appeared in recent years, we noted that its principle has been used for decades when it comes to decision-making through simulation. Moreover, there are still many discussions and uncertainties regarding the simulation model in this research field, such as the degree of autonomy, synchronisation, and connection. These and other key issues are discussed and some research opportunities are highlighted, such as the need for constant model validation and integration between various models. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,Decision making Decision support systems Discrete event simulation Agent based simulation Decision supports Degree of autonomy Physical systems Productive process Research opportunities Scientific journals Systematic literature review Digital twinagent-based simulation decision-making Digital Twin discrete event simulation systematic literature review,academic,"Production Engineering and Management Institute, Federal University of Itajubá (UNIFEI), Itajubá, Brazil",333,0.2564102564102564
Decision-making in a fast fashion company in the Industry 4.0 era: a Digital Twin proposal to support operational planning,"This work explores the improvement of operational decision-making in a Fast Fashion manufacturing company, considering the Industry 4.0 era. The segment requires agile and flexible decision-making techniques to guarantee the companies survival in a high variety environment of products and demand. The proposed approach was based on three stages. First, we suggested changes and improvements in the system to adapt it to the Industry 4.0 principles. Then, we proposed a Digital Twin (DT) focused on operational resource planning (physical and human). The DT was composed of a Discrete Event Simulation model, an Artificial Intelligence model, and a decision dashboard that provides a user-friendly interface for the decision-maker. Finally, the last stage corresponds to cyclical and constant DT-based decision-making. The DT-based decisions helped to decrease the number of operators in the line reducing their idleness and, at the same time, the total lead time became shorter. Therefore, we highlight that the concepts and solutions of Industry 4.0 might be consistent with small companies without major structural changes, contributing to the evolution of the manufacturing systems. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2021,Artificial intelligence Digital twin Discrete event simulation Industry 4.0 User interfaces Decision makers Discrete-event simulation model Fashion companies Manufacturing companies Operational decision making Operational planning Resource planning User friendly interface Decision makingArtificial intelligence Digital Twin Discrete event simulation Fast fashion Industry 4.0 Operational planning,academic,"Production Engineering and Management Institute, Federal University of Itajubá (UNIFEI), Ave. BPS, Itajubá, 1303, Minas Gerais, Brazil",333,0.20454545454545456

The digital twin of the business process model,"In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of organizational management based on high-precision simulation models designed for numerical forecasting of the parameters of business process models - duration, labor intensity and resource intensity, cost. The solution is implemented as a prototype twin of the business process system model. To solve the problem of predicting the numerical indicators of a business process model, the formula and algorithmic apparatus of stochastic GERT networks is used. BPMS ELMA was used as a technical platform for the implementation of a digital twin prototype. To solve this problem, the apparatus of stochastic GERT networks is used. An edge of the GERT network is associated with the operation of the business process, and the node of the GERT network with an event or gateway of the business process. An algorithm for translating a model of a business process into an equivalent GERT network, as well as calculating the parameters of the law of distribution of the cost of a business process based on the obtained GERT network, is given. The proposed tool, implemented in the digital twin modeling module, allows solving the problems of predicting the dynamics of discrete-event models described in BPMN notation without using statistical simulation models. Continuous updating of the structure of the GERT-model in accordance with the modification of the process in the ELMA system and clarification of the parameters of probabilities, the type of distribution laws and their parameters based on the accumulated data of the digital shadow of the business process allows us to talk about the implementation of a high-precision forecasting model of the business process in the proposed digital twin model. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2020,Costs Critical path analysis Digital twin Forecasting Gateways (computer networks) Probability distributions Stochastic models Stochastic systems Business process model Continuous updating Discrete event models Forecasting modeling Law of distribution Numerical forecasting Organizational management Statistical simulation Discrete event simulation,academic,"Reshetnev Siberian State University of Science and Technology, ""Krasnoyarsky rabochy""avenue 31, Krasnoyarsk, Russian Federation",333,0.3684210526315789

Digital Twin in biomanufacturing: challenges and opportunities towards its implementation,"The domain of industrial biomanufacturing is enthusiastically embracing the concept of Digital Twin, owing to its promises of increased process efficiency and resource utilisation. However, Digital Twin in biomanufacturing is not yet clearly defined and this sector of the industry is falling behind the others in terms of its implementation. On the other hand, some of the benefits of Digital Twin seem to overlap with the more established practices of process control and optimization, and the term is vaguely used in different scenarios. In an attempt to clarify this issue, we investigate this overlap for the specific case of fermentation operation, a central step in many biomanufacturing processes. Based on this investigation, a framework built upon a five-step pathway starting from a basic steady-state process model is proposed to develop a fully-fledged Digital Twin. For demonstration purposes, the framework is applied to a bench-scale second-generation ethanol fermentation process as a case study. It is proposed that the success or failure of a fully-fledged Digital Twin implementation is determined by key factors that comprise the role of modelling, human operator actions, and other propositions of economic value. © 2021, Jiangnan University.",2021,Biomanufacturing Digital Twin Fermentation Modelling Process control,academic,"Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, Process and Systems Engineering Center (PROSYS), Technical University of Denmark, Building 228 A, Kgs.

Representing financial data streams in digital simulations to support data flow design for a future Digital Twin,"Discrete Event Simulations may be used to forecast detailed production system behaviour under future conditions and support better informed decision making. However, data beyond production metrics, e.g. financial information, is also necessary for most significant decisions. Herein a modelling approach is proposed and demonstrated based on simulating both production and financial transactions. The contribution of this paper is to represent the base production events as well as additional events which trigger financial transactions. The method is demonstrated for an idealised production business, employing Discrete Event Simulation and examining the impact of system labour arrangements on the business cash flow with a variable demand based on a normal probability distribution function (with distinct means and variances for each product). Based on the financial transactions a representation of a detail commercial scenario may be modelled alongside the production events. The presented studies identify the potential sensitivity of analysis to the volume and timing of transactions on accumulated accounting metrics such as profit. Additionally the paper illustrates how such a modelling approach can be used to characterise the system and assess specific control strategies when both production and finance data streams are available. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020,Decision making Discrete event simulation Distribution functions Sensitivity analysis Financial information Financial metrics Financial transactions Normal probability distributions Production business Production demand Real-time forecasting Resource planning FinanceDiscrete Event Simulation Factory Digital Twin Financial metrics Industrial Internet of Things Labour resource planning Production demand Real time forecasting,academic,"School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Queen's University Belfast, Ashby Building, Belfast, BT9 5AH, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom; N.I.

Defining Production and Financial Data Streams Required for a Factory Digital Twin to Optimise the Deployment of Labour,With the emergence of capable and low cost sensing hardware simulations may be driven from real time production data. Such simulation could be used to predict future system performance. However for effective decision making knowledge of system level behaviour beyond production e.g. financial metrics would also be required. The generation of standard accounting data from simulation models has received little attention in the literature. Herein a modelling approach is demonstrated to generate production and accounting data streams from a Discrete Event Simulation for an idealised production business.

Digital twin framework for reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs): design and simulation,"Faced with the global crisis of COVID-19 and the strong increase in customer demands, competition is becoming more intense between companies, on the one hand, and supply chains on the other. This competition has led to the development of new strategies to manage demand and increase market share. Among these strategies are the growing interest in sustainable manufacturing and the need for customizable products that create an increasingly complex manufacturing environment. Sustainable manufacturing and the need for customizable products create an environment of increased competition and constant change. Indeed, companies are trying to establish more flexible and agile manufacturing systems through several systems of reconfiguration. Reconfiguration contributes to an extension of the manufacturing system’s life cycle by modifying its physical, organizational and IT characteristics according to the changing market conditions. Due to the rapid development of new information technology (such as IoT, Big Data analytics, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing and artificial intelligence), digital twins have become intensively used in smart manufacturing.

Generic framework for developing process digital twin applicable to high value-added manufacturing,"Our team has developed a generic modular framework to create Process Digital Twin (PDT) that can be customized for any process. Elements of this framework are (i) configuration of manufacturing process inputs as seen by user, (ii) capturing variation of manufacturing inputs (iii) build accurate and fast multi-parametric numerical solution using advanced model order reduction (MOR) techniques, (iv) Extract features for quality (FFQ) using specialized algorithms and (v) predict probability of success from quality models and (vi) capability to receive post-production process and quality data and use machine learning algorithms to automatically update various models. Irrespective of the physical and geometrical complexity of individual process, our numerical techniques assure a real time (< 10 sec) multi-parametric solution. Primary output of process digital twin (PDT) is predicting probability of success of a process based on all manufacturing inputs both material and physical. This allows us to use PDT to maximize production success by adjusting controllable inputs apriori. We have successfully used the framework to build digital twins for complex composite manufacturing processes that produce fan blades for aircraft engines and implemented it into manufacturing process.

Reconfigurable manufacturing systems characteristics in digital twin context,"The concept of a reconfigurable manufacturing system (RMS) has been introduced to enable production systems to continuously evolve and respond rapidly to unpredicted and fluctuating market environments. To achieve this goal, RMS needs to exhibit six core characteristics: modularity, integrability, scalability, diagnosability, convertibility and customisation. These characteristics are required to ensure manufacturing systems' resilience while maintaining productivity and quality. Assessing these characteristics at both the design and operating phase can be aided by the digital twinning (DT) of physical systems. To this end, the DT-RMS concept is introduced in this paper as a dynamic cyber-replica of the physical production environment, enabling a high-level of transparency about data, performance, and relevant reconfiguration decisions. As a result, DT-RMS responds to the need to integrate requirements and performance targets for the RMS characteristics at design and operating-time.

A digital twin emulator of a modular production system using a data-driven hybrid modeling and simulation approach,"Virtual commissioning is a key technology in Industry 4.0 that can address issues faced by engineers during early design phases. The process of virtual commissioning involves the creation of a Digital Twin—a dynamic, virtual representation of a corresponding physical system. The digital twin model can be used for testing and verifying the control system in a simulated virtual environment to achieve rapid set-up and optimization prior to physical commissioning. Additionally, the modular production control systems, can be integrated and tested during or prior to the construction of the physical system. This paper describes the implementation of a digital twin emulator of an automated mechatronic modular production system that is linked with the running programmable logic controllers and allow for exchanging near real-time information with the physical system. The development and deployment of the digital twin emulator involves a novel hybrid simulation- and data-driven modeling approach that combines Discrete Event Simulation and Agent Based Modeling paradigms.

Mixed discrete-continuous simulation for digital Twins,"The advent of Digital Twins has precipitated the need for an open and flexible simulation framework with unique design considerations. A key requirement of such a framework is the ability to simulate systems containing a mix of discrete and continuous processes that may interact with each other.

How to model and implement connections between physical and virtual models for digital twin application,"Digital twin (DT) is a virtual mirror (representation) of a physical world or a system along its lifecycle. As for a complex discrete manufacturing system (DMS), it is a digital model for emulating or reproducing the functions or actions of a real manufacturing system by giving the system simulation information or directly driven by a real system with proper connections between the DT model and the real-world system. It is a key building block for smart factory and manufacturing under the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The key research question is how to effectively create a DT model during the design stage of a complex manufacturing system and to make it usable throughout the system's lifecycle such as the production stage. Given that there are some existing discussions on DT framework development, this paper focuses on the modeling methods for rapidly creating a virtual model and the connection implementation mechanism between a physical world production system at a workshop level and its mirrored virtual model. To reach above goals, in this paper, the discrete event system (DES) modeling theory is applied to the three-dimension DT model. First, for formally representing a manufacturing system and creating its virtual model, seven basic elements: controller, executor, processor, buffer, flowing entity, virtual service node and logistics path of a DMS have been identified and the concept of the logistics path network and the service cell is introduced to uniformly describe a manufacturing system. Second, for implementing interconnection and interaction, a new interconnection and data interaction mechanism between the physical system and its virtual model for through-life applications has been designed. With them, each service cell consists of seven elements and encapsulates input/output information and control logic. All the discrete cells are constructed and mapped onto different production-process-oriented digital manufacturing modules by integrating logical, geometric and data models. As a result, the virtual-physical connection is realized to form a DT model. The proposed virtual modeling method and the associated connection mechanism have been applied to a real-world workshop DT to demonstrate its practicality and usefulness. © 2020 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2021,Complex networks Digital twin Industrial research Life cycle Manufacture Complex manufacturing systems Digital manufacturing Discrete manufacturing systems Framework development Implementation mechanisms Physical connections Research questions System simulations Discrete event simulationCyber-physical system Digital twin Discrete event system modeling theory Virtual-physical connection,academic,"Institute of Advanced Design and Manufacturing, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, 610031, China; School of Design, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 8ST, United Kingdom",378,0.3
Simulation-Based Digital Twin of a Complex Shop-Floor Logistics System,"Digital analytics tools have been at the forefront of innovation in manufacturing industry in recent years.

In this paper we focus on the relevance of dynamic models in this scenario, particularly as for the co-existence of continuous-time and discrete-event models wherever control and planning are involved. We argue that in such cases, models with analysis-specific levels of detail have to co-exist, interact and maintain mutual consistency.

Addressing this problem, the purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of DTs and simulation models for CPS in production logistics. This study reviews extant literature on DTs and presents findings from a single case study at a South Korean manufacturing company developing a DT including Discrete Event Simulation (DES). The findings of this study highlight the importance of DES in DTs focusing on increased production logistics performance. The results of this study indicate that the use of DES may promote the development of DTs, but be insufficient in the characterization of DTs for CPS in production logistics. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",2020,Cyber Physical System Decision making Discrete event simulation Embedded systems Industrial management Manufacture Critical component Current simulation Cyber-physical systems (CPS) Manufacturing companies Production logistics Digital twinDigital Twins Discrete Event Simulation Production logistics,academic,"KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Södertälje, 15136, Sweden; Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, 16419, South Korea",378,0.34375
Digital twins in advanced manufacturing current and future,"One of the key industrial challenges of today's manufacturing companies is to adopt new technologies to transform their manufacturing processes, to be able to make things in a “smarter” way. One of the promising ways to become smarter is the so-called digitalisation of the manufacturing system in the context of industry 4.0. In which, digital twins play an important role within this digitalisation journey. Since recent years, the Digital Twin has become a synonym for the cyber-part of a cyber-physical system (CPS) (Kunath & Winkler, 2018). It is predicted that companies who invest in digital twin technology will see a 30 percent improvement in cycle times of critical processes (IDC, 2018). The future of digital twin development is foreseen to be able to embed with artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as genetic algorithm models, machine learning and deep neural networks to accelerate decision-makings processes and support manufactures to improve efficiency and productivity.

Structured Development of Digital Twins—A Cross-Domain Analysis towards a Unified Approach,"Digital Twins (DT) as digital representations are increasingly becoming operational design tools in a variety of contexts. Although a common understanding of the concept and the underlying development procedure would facilitate DT applications, only limited information has been published on the essential stages of development and fundamental development activities. This paper examines the extent to which an abstract, and thus generally applicable model for the development of Digital Twins can be identified. In order to come up with such a reference procedure, a structured analysis of published development experiences has been performed. Three major application domains, namely product lifecycle management, manufacturing, and predictive maintenance, could be detailed and cross-checked. For each of these domains, a contextual development model could be derived from empirically valid design and engineering practices. The data also allowed for the determination of which way each model corresponds to existing Digital Twin concepts. The use of a standard modeling notation enabled the integration of the domain-specific models into a single Digital Twin development model. As a result, developers are guided by domain-independent and -dependent development steps. Due to its generic structure, the model can serve for further domain explorations. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,digital twin process analysis process modeling reference modeling,academic,"Business Informatics-Communications Engineering, Business School, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, 4040, Austria",384,0.5

Realizing A Digital Twin of An Organization Using Action-oriented Process Mining,"A Digital Twin of an Organization (DTO) is a mirrored representation of an organization, aiming to improve the business process of the organization by providing a transparent view over the process and automating management actions to deal with existing and potential risks.

A Requirements Driven Digital Twin Framework: Specification and Opportunities,"Among the tenets of Smart Manufacturing (SM) or Industry 4.0 (I4.0), digital twin (DT), which represents the capabilities of virtual representations of components and systems, has been cited as the biggest technology trend disrupting engineering and design today. DTs have been in use for years in areas such as model-based process control and predictive maintenance, however moving forward a framework is needed that will support the expected pervasiveness of DT technology in the evolution of SM or I4.0. A set of requirements for a DT framework has been derived from analysis of DT definitions, DTs in use today, expected DT applications in the near future, and longer-term DT trends and the DT vision in SM. These requirements include elements of re-usability, interoperability, interchangeability, maintainability, extensibility, and autonomy across the entire DT lifecycle. A baseline framework for DT technology has been developed that addresses many aspects of these requirements and enables the addressing of the requirements more fully through additional specification. The baseline framework includes a definition of a DT and an object-oriented (O-O) architecture for DTs that defines generalization, aggregation and instantiation of DT classes.

Application of the Digital Twin Concept to Solve the Monitoring Task of Machine-Building Technological Process,"The digital twin (DT) of a process is a prospective tool for designing modern digital productions based on the Industry 4.0 concept. The development of technological process (TP) DT provides a large amount of data acquisition connected with product processing into a single information structure. The structure may contain the values of different technological parameters and the workshop's utilized resources data. From this point of view, the monitoring of machine-building TP can be implemented and based on the DT process. The development of this approach was the purpose of the research. The scientific publication analysis showed the approach under consideration is relevant and insufficiently developed from a scientific point of view. The authors propose the structure of TP DT for high variety low volume machine-building production in this paper.

Contribution to the development of a Digital Twin based on product lifecycle to support the manufacturing process,"The current manufacture challenges are closely linked to the aim of digitalizing the product, the process and the means of production. In such aspects, information about the production processes is available in real-time, allowing managers to act on digital models and, through them, apply decisions in real systems. Thus, having a mirror model or a Digital Twin enables real-time absorption, simulation and implementation of manufacturing variations from the real environment, allowing faster detection of physical problems, and faster production response. The Digital Twin is a virtual representation of the physical system, which is equipped with sensors and actuators and feed the digital system, where the monitoring of data and simulation of variations, for instance, take place. From the synchronized interactions of both components, it is possible to deliver the mentioned faster production responses. Brazilian and German universities joined efforts to develop a Digital Twin based on product lifecycle to support the Manufacturing Process to address these challenges. The proposed Digital Twin seeks to integrate the product twin and the twin of its development process. It shall represent the manufacturing process, enabling the monitoring and optimization of the real production process. The Digital Twin itself is addressed as a product inside the production system and, therefore, its development process will follow the product lifecycle perspective, from the conception and planning to its implementation and usage. The Digital Twin will be further improved with the introduction of Artificial Intelligence tools, characterizing a Smart Digital Twin of the Manufacturing Process. Thus, this paper aims to present the concepts of a research project that is being developed in a joint Brazilian-German Cooperative Research. © 2019 The Authors.

A hierarchical integrated modeling method for the digital twin of mechanical products,"With the development of information and communication technology, massive amounts of data are generated during the entire lifecycle of mechanical products. However, their isolated and fragmented state hinders further empowerment of smart manufacturing. Digital twins have attracted considerable attention as they enable a user to rebuild all elements of a physical entity in a virtual space, targeted at the effective fusion of data from multiple sources with different formats, while its modeling method still needs further research. In this context, we propose a native, full-element digital twin modeling method for mechanical products. This ontology-based method establishes a unified and computer-understandable model framework for mechanical products by abstracting the essential content and relationships of data and by storing them in a graph database efficiently. The developed model could serve as a data center for the entire lifecycle of the product or could be combined with existing data management systems, integrating the previously isolated, fragmented, and scattered data on various platforms. In addition, the model utilizes the structural characteristics of mechanical products and is developed as a hierarchical digital mapping to better meet the application requirements. Finally, a case study of a helicopter digital twin is presented to verify the proposed method. © 2021 by the authors.

Conceptual Modeling of Lifecycle Digital Twin Architecture for Bridges: A Data Structure Approach,"The concept of Digital Twin (DT) has emerged in recent years to facilitate the use of Building Information Modeling during the entire projects' lifecycle. In the DT concept, cyber-physical system theory is utilized to collect condition data about an existing asset and then integrate this data into the digital model. The major limitation though is that the current scope of DT is limited to the operation and maintenance phase. Nevertheless, the DT concept can be extended to the entire lifecycle of the asset if the relevant sensory and non-sensory data are incorporated into the digital model in an automated and systematic way. However, in the current literature, there is no clear insight about such a holistic and life-cycle DT concept for infrastructure projects. Especially, there is very little understanding about how various sensory and non-sensory data from construction and operation phases can be seamlessly integrated into the 3D BIM models. Therefore, this research aims to develop a conceptual model for the architecture of Lifecycle DT (LDT) focusing on bridges. To this end, an ontological modeling approach is adopted. The proposed ontology is validated through a workshop session where domain experts assessed the results with respect to some competency questions. The outcome of the session indicated that the proposed ontology scored sufficiently in all the criteria and succeeded in satisfying the information needs of the LDT. Overall, the proposed model offers an insight into a lifecycle modeling practice as well as automated data incorporation, enabling a smooth transition towards an upgraded modeling practice. © 2022 International Association on Automation and Robotics in Construction.",2022,Architectural design Bridges Embedded systems Information theory Ontology Robotics 'current Bridge information modeling Building Information Modelling Conceptual model Digital modeling Information Modeling Lifecycle digital twin Ontological modeling Ontology's Sensory data Life cycleBridge information modelling Digital twin Lifecycle digital twin Ontological modelling,academic,"Department of Construction Management & Engineering, University of Twente, Netherlands",409,0.21951219512195122
Data Evolution Governance for Ontology-based Digital Twin Product Lifecycle Management,"Product life cycle management (PLM) is an effective method for enhancing the market competitiveness of modern manufacturing industries. The digital twin is characterized by a profound integration of physics and information systems, which provides a technical means for integrating multi-source information and breaking the time and space barrier of communication at each link of the life cycle. Currently, however, the application of this technology focuses primarily on the product itself and &#x201C;service-oriented&#x201D; application results. There is a lack of focus on twin data and its internal evolutionary mechanisms separately. In the management of global data resources, the benefits of digital twin technology cannot be fully realized. This paper applies ontology technology in an innovative manner to the field of the digital twin to increase the reusability of twin data. Initially, a four-layered ontology-based twin data management architecture (OTDM) is presented. Then, a three-dimensional and three-granularity unified evolution model of full-life-cycle twin data is proposed, as well as its ontology model. Then, the service mode of data components at each stage of the life cycle is defined, a knowledge-sharing plane is established in the digital twin, and a data governance method based on ontology reasoning using data components on the shared plane is proposed. The ICandyBox simulation platform is then used to demonstrate the concept of the proposed method, and future research directions are proposed.

"Integration of Design, Manufacturing, and Service Based on Digital Twin to Realize Intelligent Manufacturing","Complex product design, manufacturing, and service are the key elements of a product’s life cycle. However, the traditional manufacturing processes of design, manufacturing, and service are independent of each other, so lack deep integration. The emergence of digital twins offers an opportunity to accelerate the integration of complex product design, manufacturing, and services. For intelligent manufacturing, physical entity and virtual entity transformation can be realized through digital information. A collaborative framework for complex product design, manufactur-ing, and service integration based on digital twin technology was proposed. The solutions of process integration, data flow, modeling and simulation, and information fusion were analyzed. The core characteristics and key technologies of service‐oriented manufacturing, design for service and man-ufacturing, and manufacturing monitoring based on the deep integration of the digital twin were discussed. Finally, the feasibility of the framework was verified by a self‐balancing multistage pump manufacturing case. The performance of the upgraded pump under the framework was tested, and the test results proved the effectiveness of the integrated framework. © 2022 by the authors.

Design and Implementation of Digital Twin-Based Application for Global Manufacturing Enterprises,"Nowadays, global competition in the manufacturing sector is increasingly fierce. Thus, global manufacturing companies must have a manufacturing system that ensures the production of reasonably priced, high-quality products, while meeting the needs of various customers. To address this issue, smart manufacturing should be implemented by adopting various information and communication technologies and convergence with existing manufacturing industries. One of the key technologies required for the implementation of smart manufacturing is a cyber-physical system (CPS). One of the major factors for the successful construction of a CPS is digital twin (DT). In this paper, we propose a standards-based information model for building a DT application, which is a key technology of a CPS-based integrated platform, by overcoming the heterogeneous device environment of global manufacturers and using data collected from various manufacturing sites. Furthermore, we propose a concept of modeling and simulation-based DT application. The DT application proposed in this study facilitates monitoring, diagnosis, and prediction at manufacturing sites using real-time data collected from various environments by ensuring interoperability.

Information modeling for cyber-physical production system based on digital twin and AutomationML,"Production systems play an important role in intelligent manufacturing. A large number of manufacturing resources are designed and developed with virtual (digital) ones, which will be associated with the physical ones throughout their lifecycle. With the recent emergence of information and communications technologies (ICTs), such as internet of things, big data, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and 5G, the interconnection and interaction between physical resources and virtual ones become possible in production systems. Digital twin (DT) shows great potential to realize the cyber-physical production system (CPPS) in the era of Industry 4.0. In this paper, we present our vision on integrating various physical resources into CPPS via DT and AutomationML. To elaborate on how to apply ICTs, this paper firstly explores a generic architecture of CPPS based on DT. DT is a virtual and authoritative representation of physical manufacturing resource, since DT includes various models and manufacturing big data of resource. The proposed architecture is illustrated in detail as follows: (1) physical layer, (2) network layer, (3) virtual layer, and (4) application layer. A case of expert fault diagnose for aircraft engine is presented using the proposed information fusion in the architecture. Secondly, this paper proposes an approach of information modeling for CPPS based on AutomationML. Various manufacturing services can be encapsulated and defined in the standardized format (AutomationML), and then the corresponding virtual manufacturing resources (DTs) will be integrated into CPPS.

Smart shop-floor is one of the basic units of smart manufacturing. With the development of the advanced technologies (e.g. cloud computing, internet of things, model-based definition, advanced simulation, artificial intelligence), a larger number of virtual shop-floors are being built. However, it is very important that how to realize the intelligent interconnection and interaction between physical shop-floors and virtual ones. Digital twin (DT) is one of the key technologies associated to the cyber-physical system.

Digital twin-based smart production management and control framework for the complex product assembly shop-floor,"Digital twin technology is considered as a key technology to realize cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, due to the complexity of building a digital equivalent in virtual space to its physical counterpart, very little progress has been achieved in digital twin application, especially in the complex product assembly shop-floor.

Production Recipe Validation through Formalization and Digital Twin Generation,"The advent of Industry 4.0 is making production processes every day more complicated. As such, early process validation is becoming crucial to avoid production errors thus decreasing costs. In this paper, we present an approach to validate production recipes. Initially, the recipe is specified according to the ISA-95 standard, while the production plant is described using AutomationML. These specifications are formalized into a hierarchy of assume-guarantee contracts.

PhysiNet: A combination of physics-based model and neural network model for digital twins,"As the real-time digital counterpart of a physical system or process, digital twins are utilized for system simulation and optimization. Neural networks are one way to build a digital twins model by using data especially when a physics-based model is not accurate or even not available. However, for a newly designed system, it takes time to accumulate enough data for neural network models and only an approximate physics-based model is available. To take advantage of both models, this paper proposed a model that combines the physics-based model and the neural network model to improve the prediction accuracy for the whole life cycle of a system. The proposed hybrid model (PhysiNet) was able to automatically combine the models and boost their prediction performance. Experiments showed that the PhysiNet outperformed both the physics-based model and the neural network model. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2022,Digital counterparts Model networks Neural network model Physical process Physical systems Physics-based models Real- time Simulation and optimization System optimizations System simulations Life cycledigital twin neural networks physics-based model system modeling,academic,"Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre, University of Sheffield, Rotherham, United Kingdom",418,0.25806451612903225
The use of Digital Twin for predictive maintenance in manufacturing,"This paper presents a methodology to calculate the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machinery equipment by utilising physics-based simulation models and Digital Twin concept, in order to enable predictive maintenance for manufacturing resources using Prognostics and health management (PHM) techniques. The resources and the properties of them are first modelled in a digital environment able to simulate the real machine’s behaviour. Data are gathered by machines’ controllers and external sensors to be used for the synchronous tuning of the digital models and their simulation. The outcome of the simulation is then used to assess the resource’s condition and to calculate RUL. In this way, the condition and the status of the machines can be monitored and predicted as a result from the simulation of physics-based models, without invasive techniques of common predictive maintenance solutions. A case study is presented in this paper where the proposed methodology is validated by predicting the RUL of an industrial robot. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2019,Machinery Manufacture Manufacturing resource Physics-based modeling Physics-based Simulation Predictive maintenance Prognostics and health managements Remaining useful lives Rul predictions simulation MaintenanceManufacturing physics-based model predictive maintenance RUL prediction simulation,academic,"Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems and Automation, Department of Mechanical Engineering and Aeronautics, University of Patras, Patras, Greece",418,0.25

A Surrogate Model to Predict Production Performance in Digital Twin-Based Smart Manufacturing,"With the dynamic arrival of production orders and unforeseen changes in shop-floor conditions within a production system, production scheduling presents a challenge for manufacturing firms to ensure production demands are met with high productivity and low operating cost. Before a production schedule is generated to process the incoming production orders, production planning is performed. Given the large number of input parameters involved in the production planning, it poses the challenge on how to systematically and accurately predict and evaluate production performance. Hence, it is important to understand the interactions of the input parameters between the production planning and the scheduling. This is to ensure that the production planning and the scheduling are coordinated and can be performed to achieve optimal production performance such as minimizing cost effectively and efficiently. Digital twin presents an opportunity to mirror the real-time production status and analyze the input parameters affecting the production performance in smart manufacturing. In this paper, we propose an approach to develop a surrogate model to predict the production performance using input parameters from a production plan using the capabilities of real-time synchronization of production data in digital twin. Multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) is applied to construct a surrogate model based on three categories of input parameters, i.e., current production system load, machine-based and product-based parameters. An industrial case study involving a wafer fabrication production is used to develop the surrogate model based on a random sampling of varying numbers of training data set. The proposed MARS model shows a high correlation coefficient and a large reduction in the number of input parameters for both linear and nonlinear cases with relation to three performances, namely flowtime, tardiness, and machine utilization.

Toward digital validation for rapid product development based on digital twin: a framework,"Product development should cover product design, validation, and manufacturing. In traditional product development, physical validation based on physical trial manufacturing is the key step to confirm the design scheme before physical manufacturing. However, physical validation is costly and inefficient, which could be the main obstacle to achieving rapid product development. The emergence of digital twin provides an opportunity to accelerate product development by eliminating physical validation toward digital validation in the smart manufacturing era. Therefore, a framework of rapid product development based on digital twin is proposed in this paper. During product development, the new product is designed according to the new requirements in the virtual space, in which the existing digital twins of products can be referenced. Then, an ultrahigh-fidelity virtual manufacturing system is constructed for digital trial manufacturing based on the digital twin of the manufacturing system and the design scheme of the new product. An ultrahigh-fidelity digital prototype can be obtained from digital trial manufacturing for digital validation. The new product validation is executed on the digital prototype to test its performance. The digital validation results can be used to improve the design scheme of the new product and boost the corresponding manufacturing processes. In addition, the core characteristics and key technologies of rapid product development based on digital twin are discussed. Finally, a case study is presented to implement the proposed framework and to show the effectiveness of accelerating product development. © 2021, The Author(s).",2022,Agile manufacturing systems Digital devices Product design Design scheme Design validation Digital prototype Digital validation Manufacturing IS Product manufacturing Product validation Rapid product development Smart manufacturing Traditional products Product developmentDigital twin Digital validation Product development Smart manufacturing,academic,"School of Mechanical Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, 100081, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China; AVIC Technology Co.

Automated manufacturing system discovery and digital twin generation,"The latest developments in industry involved the deployment of digital twins for both long and short term decision making, such as supply chain management, production planning and control. Modern production environments are frequently subject to disruptions and consequent modifications. As a result, the development of digital twins of manufacturing systems cannot rely solely on manual operations. Recent contributions proposed approaches to exploit data for the automated generation of the models. However, the resulting representations can be excessively accurate and may also describe activities that are not significant for estimating the system performance. Generating models with an appropriate level of detail can avoid useless efforts and long computation times, while allowing for easier understanding and re-usability. This paper proposes a method to automatically discover manufacturing systems and generate adequate digital twins. The relevant characteristics of a production system are automatically retrieved from data logs. The proposed method has been applied on two test cases and a real manufacturing line. The experimental results prove its effectiveness in generating digital models that can correctly estimate the system performance. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2021,Decision making Digital twin Production control Supply chain management Automated generation Automated manufacturing systems Generating models Latest development Manual operations Manufacturing lines Production environments Production planning and control ManufactureDigital twins Industry 4.0 Manufacturing systems Process mining Simulation,academic,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Via La Masa 1, Milan, 20156, Italy",419,0.32432432432432434
Creation of digital twins - Key characteristics of physical to virtual twinning in mechatronic product development,"Due to the falling costs of computational resources and the increasing potential of data acquisition, interest in digital twins, a virtual copy of the physical original, and their industrial application is increasing. Nevertheless, there is limited published work on how to support the process of physical to virtual twinning and what its key aspects are. The aim of this study is to present insights with regards to physical to virtual twinning gained from modelling projects in mechatronic product development. We conducted a survey and in-depth interviews with members of modelling projects. In the surveys and interviews we identified how physical products and virtual models were linked, which virtual models were used and which general challenges and key aspects are considered important by the project members.

A digital twin-based approach for multi-objective optimization of short-term production planning,"Short-term multi-product production planning strongly depends on manifold considerations which can be related to backlog production, product-type prioritization, machine capacity, and set-ups. Different manufacturing systems conditions may lead to different objectives. In this context, it is rather difficult to define a-priori optimal production plans. This paper presents an effective approach for short-term production planning of multi-product systems based on the integration of a Digital Twin and a multi-objective optimization method. The proposed approach has been implemented in a real industrial case of the railway sector.

The digital twin as a core component for industry 4.0 smart production planning,"Production systems that adhere the Industry 4.0 vision require new ways of control and integration of individual components, such as robots, transportation system shuttles or mobile platforms. This paper proposes a new production system control concept based on closing a feedback loop between a production planning system and a digital twin of the physical production system. The digital twin keeps up-to-date information about the current state of the physical production system and it is combined with the production planner utilizing artificial intelligence methods. Production recipes and concrete process instantiations are planned for each production order on-the-fly, based on the production system state retrieved form the digital twin. This approach provides a high flexibility in terms of ability to add and to remove products as well as production resources. It also enables error recovery by re-planning the production if some failure happens. The proposed approach is tested and evaluated on an internally hosted Industry 4.0 testbed, which confirms its efficiency and flexibility.

Challenges and potentials of digital twins and industry 4.0 in product design and production for high performance products,"Digital twins offer great opportunities in various domains of the product engineering process. However, current approaches to the use of digital twins only focus on different separated disciplines. In contrast to that, it is expected that the holistic use of digital twin models in product development and production will dominate future product generations, because they allow to create high-performance products competitively. This paper explores important challenges and future potentials of digital twins and Industry 4.0 for the seamless integration of product specification and production. In this regard, approaches of linking digital twins to other domains open up new possibilities in tolerance allocation and production integration. Thereby, the most efficient product specifications in technical and economic terms are achieved for the manufacturer. In addition, the connectivity of Industry 4.0 broadens the scope and enables the evaluation of alternative approaches in production planning and control. Approaches at the organizational level, product functions with specifications beyond the technological limits and production control strategies (e.g. order dispatching) ensure high performance operations. Simulations with a digital production twin with integrated digital product twin allow early estimations even before the actual ramp-up of the product. The future challenge addressed in this paper is to define a consistent framework for the holistic use of digital twins in the entire product development process, which requires the integration of product designers and production planner concepts. © 2019 The Authors.

Building a right digital twin with model engineering,"In recent years, the concept of digital twin (DT) is attracting more and more attention from researchers and engineers. But there is still no consensus on what a right DT is. On one hand, some common models are renamed as DTs. On the other hand, some DTs extremely pursue ‘the same’ as physical objects, which bring unnecessary complexities to them. In this paper, we try to answer two questions from the point of view of model engineering: how to define a right digital twin, and how to build a right digital twin. The concept and related technologies of model engineering are introduced. Some basic principles and a set of metrics for a right DT are given. An evolutionary concurrent modeling method for DT (ECoM4DT) is proposed not only inheriting the theory from classic M&S methods but also highlighting the characteristics of DT compared with traditional models to systemically guide the DT modeling process. © 2021 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",2021,Engineering Industrial engineering Basic principles Common models Concurrent modeling Model engineering Modeling process Physical objects S-method Traditional models Digital twinComplex system Digital twin Model engineering Modeling and simulation,academic,"Beihang University, Beijing, 100191, China; Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, 02139, MA, United States",426,0.32142857142857145

Conceptual digital twin modeling based on an integrated five-dimensional framework and TRIZ function model,"Digital twin represents a fusion of the informational and physical domains, to bridge the material and virtual worlds. Existing methods of digital twin modeling are mainly based on modular representation, which limits guidance of the modeling process. Such methods do not consider the components or operational rules of the digital twin in detail, thereby preventing designers from applying these methods in their fields. With the increasing application of digital twin to various engineering fields, an effective method of modeling a multi-dimensional digital twin at the conceptual level is required. To such an end, this paper presents a method for the conceptual modeling of a digital twin based on a five-dimensional digital twin framework to represent the complex relationship between digital twin objects and their attributes.

Implementation of digital twin for engine block manufacturing processes,"The digital twin (DT) is undergoing an increase in interest from both an academic and industrial perspective. Although many authors proposed and described various frameworks for DT implementation in the manufacturing industry context, there is an absence of real-life implementation studies reported in the available literature. The main aim of this paper is to demonstrate feasibility of the DT implementation under real conditions of a production plant that is specializing in manufacturing of the aluminum components for the automotive industry. The implementation framework of the DT for engine block manufacturing processes consists of three layers: physical layer, virtual layer and information-processing layer. A simulation model was created using the Tecnomatix Plant Simulation (TPS) software. In order to obtain real-time status data of the production line, programmable logic control (PLC) sensors were used for raw data acquisition. To increase production line productivity, the algorithm for bottlenecks detection was developed and implemented into the DT.

Automatic generation of a simulation-based digital twin of an industrial process plant,"A Digital Twin (DT) of a production plant is a digital replica of the plant's physical assets which contains the structure and the dynamics of how the devices and process operate. Simulation-based DTs (SBDTs) are those based on online first-principles simulation models. In these systems, model parameter estimation techniques keep an online plant simulator in the same state as the targeted device or process. As a result, non-measured information of the current state of the plant can be obtained from the model. SBDTs can be used for a number of important applications and they have various advantages compared to DTs based on data-driven models. However, wider industrial adoption of SBDTs is hindered by laborious development of their underlying first-principles simulation model as well as by a lack of integrated lifecycle-wide implementation methods and simulation architectures. This paper focuses on applying previously presented methods for reducing implementation effort of SBDTs. Firstly, laborious simulation model development is tackled by applying an automatic model generation method. Secondly, an integrated implementation methodology of a lifecycle-wide online simulation architecture is followed for developing the SBDT. A SBDT of a laboratory-scale process is implemented to demonstrate the proposed method.

Demonstration of an industrial framework for an implementation of a process digital twin,"Digital twins have received a large amount of exposure around what they can offer to industry generating lots of noise, however there are few demonstrations utilizing published architectural frameworks. This has been addressed by investigating industrial publications and reports on what is the minimum essential requirements to form a digital twin and additional desirable features. From this, a generic industrial architectural framework of a digital twin has been established to utilize real-time information from a physical asset forming a monitoring digital twin. This has been expanded to incorporate a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) to form a process digital twin utilizing structured information about the process. The framework, including the DES extension, has been validated on a reconfigurable fixture utilizing an established process that has been modelled using Siemens Plant Simulation. This result forms the start of a feedback loop presenting additional value transforming a monitoring digital twin into a process digital twin.

Simulation and digital twin for mechatronic product design,"The use of digital twins and simulation models to construct, evaluate and validate designs has become an intrinsic part of every product creation process. The use in production, operation and service has been increasing in the last years, for example model predictive control or simulation-based assist systems. The challenges - and opportunities - however are multifold. Interoperability of models, model transformation and co-simulation are key to realize system level simulation. Computing performance alone cannot address the requirements posed by ever more complex systems and applications like massive design space exploration or interactive simulation, expressing the need for disruptive solver solutions. But also modeling technology needs to be extended. Integrating the digital twin with data measured on the physical assets, reusing all previously established engineering knowledge, allows new applications such as virtual sensing, model based control and hybrid system modeling including hardware, software and numerical components. © Proceedings of ISMA 2018 - International Conference on Noise and Vibration Engineering and USD 2018 - International Conference on Uncertainty in Structural Dynamics.

Refined Simulation Method for Computer-Aided Process Planning Based on Digital Twin Technology,"Simulation technology is widely used in computer-aided process planning (CAPP). The part machining process is simulated in the virtual world, which can predict manufacturing errors and optimize the process plan. Simulation accuracy is the guarantee of process decision-making and optimization. This article focuses on the use of digital twin technology to build a high-fidelity process model, taking the advantage of the integration of multiple systems, in order to achieve the dynamic association of real-time manufacturing data and process models. Making use of the CAPP/MES systems, the surface inspection data of the part is fed back to the CAPP system and associated with the digital twin process model. The wavelet transform method is used to reduce the noise of the high-frequency signal of the detection data, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated to verify the noise reduction effect. The surface topography, after noise reduction, was reconstructed in Matlab. On this basis, the Poisson reconstruction algorithm is used to reconstruct the high-fidelity process model for the refined simulation of the subsequent processes. Finally, by comparing the two sets of simulation experiments with the real machining results, we found that the simulation results, based on the digital twin model, are more accurate than the traditional simulation method by 58%. © 2022 by the authors.

Deep learning-enabled intelligent process planning for digital twin manufacturing cell,"The transition to intelligent manufacturing provides a fulcrum for the revolution of product lifecycle like design, manufacturing and maintenance, so does it for process planning. Specifically, digital twin manufacturing cell (DTMC) is regarded as a new means of and also a basic unit for implementing intelligent manufacturing. Incorporating process planning in DTMC could improve the integrity of DTMC and enhance the feasibility of process planning. Consequently, this paper proposes a deep learning-enabled framework for intelligent process planning towards DTMC. Firstly, a process knowledge reuse network (PKR-Net) that takes deep residual networks as base architecture is embedding into the framework, which could understand design intents expressed in a drawing or a 3D computer-aided design (CAD) model via its views and automatically retrieve relevant knowledge for the quick generation of theorical processes. Then, an evaluation twin is constructed to transform the theorical processes into practical operations and produce an optimal process plan. Finally, a test bed of the framework is constructed and the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2020,Computer aided design E-learning Engineering education Flexible manufacturing systems Life cycle Process planning Product design Computer aided design models Design intent Evaluation twin Intelligent Manufacturing Intelligent process planning Optimal process Process knowledge Product-life-cycle Deep learningDeep learning Digital twin manufacture cell Evaluation twin Intelligent process planning Residual networks,academic,"School of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710049, China; State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, 710054, China",427,0.2127659574468085

Digital twin for lyophilization by process modeling in manufacturing of biologics,"Lyophilization stabilizes formulated biologics for storage, transport and application to patients. In process design and operation it is the link between downstream processing and with final formulation to fill and finish. Recent activities in Quality by Design (QbD) have resulted in approaches by regulatory authorities and the need to include Process Analytical Technology (PAT) tools. An approach is outlined to validate a predictive physical‐chemical (rigorous) lyophilization process model to act quantitatively as a digital twin in order to allow accelerated process design by modeling and to further‐on develop autonomous process optimization and control towards real time release testing. Antibody manufacturing is chosen as a typical example for actual biologics needs. Literature is reviewed and the presented procedure is exemplified to quantitatively and consistently validate the physical‐chemical process model with aid of an experimental statistical DOE (design of experiments) in pilot scale. © 2020 by the authors.

Accelerating biologics manufacturing by modeling or: Is Approval under the QbD and PAT approaches demanded by authorities acceptable without a digital-twin?,"Innovative biologics, including cell therapeutics, virus-like particles, exosomes, recombinant proteins, and peptides, seem likely to substitute monoclonal antibodies as the main therapeutic entities in manufacturing over the next decades. This molecular variety causes a growing need for a general change of methods as well as mindset in the process development stage, as there are no platform processes available such as those for monoclonal antibodies. Moreover, market competitiveness demands hyper-intensified processes, including accelerated decisions toward batch or continuous operation of dedicated modular plant concepts. This indicates gaps in process comprehension, when operation windows need to be run at the edges of optimization. In this editorial, the authors review and assess potential methods and begin discussing possible solutions throughout the workflow, from process development through piloting to manufacturing operation from their point of view and experience. Especially, the state-of-the-art for modeling in red biotechnology is assessed, clarifying differences and applications of statistical, rigorous physical-chemical based models as well as cost modeling. ""Digital-twins"" are described and efforts vs. benefits for new applications exemplified, including the regulation-demanded QbD (quality by design) and PAT (process analytical technology) approaches towards digitalization or industry 4.0 based on advanced process control strategies. Finally, an analysis of the obstacles and possible solutions for any successful and efficient industrialization of innovative methods from process development, through piloting to manufacturing, results in some recommendations. A central question therefore requires attention: Considering that QbD and PAT have been required by authorities since 2004, can any biologic manufacturing process be approved by the regulatory agencies without being modeled by a ""digital-twin"" as part of the filing documentation?. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,Biologics Continuous bioprocessing Manufacturing Modeling Modular plants Process intensification Sustainability,academic,"Institute for Separation and Process Technology, Clausthal University of Technology, Leibnizstraße 15, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, D-38678, Germany",428,0.4
Digital twins in manufacturing: An assessment of key features,"In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, technological frameworks aim to arrange information and communication technologies into valuable assets to support the management of operations.

A simulation algorithm of a digital twin for manual assembly process,"Digital twin (DT) is one of the key concepts for Industry 4.0 as it is a critical component in driving real-time simulation and decision making in complex systems. The existing scientific literature on Digital twin primarily refers to a product entity or a physical machine but the core concept can be applied to the entire product lifecycle, particularly the assembly process of a complex product system. In addition, majority of existing work focus on the Digital Twins of individual machines on a shop-floor. This paper focuses on aspects the process to build DTs of a production schedule for a complex defence weapon system. The process is inherently high variety and low quantity in a very manual assembly process. This paper consists of three elements. (1) It reviews the current state of art along with the research gap and discusses how DT can become a tool to the manual assembly process. (2) A data-driven simulation algorithm is proposed to model the complex and manual manufacturing process in a generic-reusable way. (3) Finally, an appropriate complex industrial case study is studied to exemplify the proposed framework. Results demonstrate that the production managers can make more informed early decisions that can help bring assembly schedules in check and limit wasteful efforts when disruptions in the supply chain of parts sourced for the assembly occur. © 2020 The Authors.

Synchronization of Industrial Plant and Digital Twin,"Plant simulations can implement a digital twin. The digital twin is a mirror of the physical asset and shows the state of the assets and the processes at any time during production. Assets however change their behavior due to aging, faults and wear over time. If the simulation configuration and parameterization remain the same, the states of the simulation and the physical asset may drift apart. This paper suggests a method that applies optimization techniques to synchronize the states of the digital twin with the physical asset during production time and at the same time supports detecting changes and identifying their source. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,Factory automation Synchronization digital twin Optimization techniques Physical assets Plant simulation Production time simulation Simulation configuration Industrial plantsdigital twin simulation synchronization,academic,"ICT and Automation, Ifak E.V., Magdeburg, Germany; Institute of Automation Engineering (IFAT), Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany",430,0.23809523809523808
Automatic generation of digital twin industrial system from a high level specification,"A framework for the generation of industrial digital twins is presented in the paper. The framework supports industry automated systems preliminary design development, but also supports the following detailed designs implementation and final systems exploitation phases. The main problem is that requirements for first development phases are much more generic than those required for the later phases. The framework faces this problem by avoiding too detailed specifications for the digital twin generated software, but, at the same time, it takes advantage of the specific applications developed for each industrial implementation where that specificities are taken into account: the final control application and the management application. By properly linking both: the more generic digital twin and specific software applications specifically generated for the industry system, the framework may be ready to be used soon at the early development stages, but also may be used for detailed analyses at late booting and maintenance industry system phases. The system has been specialized in industrial transportation and warehouse systems. The paper presents an example of application for this kind of systems. © 2019 The Authors.

Sustainability requirements of digital twin-based systems: A meta systematic literature review,"Sustainable development was defined by the UN in 1987 as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, and this is a core concept in this paper. This work acknowledges the three dimensions of sustainability, i.e., economic, social, and environmental, but its focus is on this last one. A digital twin (DT) is frequently described as a physical entity with a virtual counterpart, and the data, connections between the two, implying the existence of connectors and blocks for efficient and effective data communication. This paper provides a meta systematic literature review (SLR) (i.e., an SLR of SLRs) regarding the sustainability requirements of DT-based systems. Numerous papers on the subject of DT were also selected because they cited the analyzed SLRs and were considered relevant to the purposes of this research. From the selection and analysis of 29 papers, several limitations and challenges were identified: the perceived benefits of DTs are not clearly understood; DTs across the product life cycle or the DT life cycle are not sufficiently studied; it is not clear how DTs can contribute to reducing costs or supporting decision-making; technical implementation of DTs must be improved and better integrated in the context of the IoT; the level of fidelity of DTs is not entirely evaluated in terms of their parameters, accuracy, and level of abstraction; and the ownership of data stored within DTs should be better understood. Furthermore, from our research, it was not possible to find a paper discussing DTs only in regard to environmental sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

Edge-based Digital Twin to trace and ensure sustainability in cross-company production networks,"Manufacturing companies aim at ensuring ecological sustainability within their value-adding processes and sustainability indicators like CO2 emissions associated to a product are becoming important selling points for customers. In consequence, manufacturers investigate and measure their manufacturing processes in order to be able to provide respective numbers, which is however hampered if products are the result of cross-company production networks: Firstly, suppliers have a high understanding of their own processes which is required for an evaluation of the respective sustainability, but are often hesitant to publish this data. In addition, digital models that allow to quantify sustainability indicators require significant data exchanges. The goal of this paper is to describe a concept for an edge-based Digital Twin for the assessment of ecological sustainability in cross-company production networks. By directly computing sustainability indicators at the place of their origin, only a minimum amount of data is being transmitted. This enables to trace the sustainability of a manufactured product while not requiring suppliers to publish sensitive data or domain knowledge. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

"Big data driven Hierarchical Digital Twin Predictive Remanufacturing paradigm: Architecture, control mechanism, application scenario and benefits","Remanufacturing is deemed to be an effective method for recycling resources, achieving sustainable production. However, little importance of remanufacturing has been attached in PLM. Surely, there are many problems in implementation of the remanufacturing strategy, such as inability to effectively reduce uncertainty, lack of product multi-life-cycle remanufacturing process tracking management, lack of smart enabling technology application in the full lifecycle that focusing on multi-life-cycle remanufacturing. After analyzing the reasons, through integrating smart enabling technologies, a new PLM paradigm focusing on the multi-life-cycle remanufacturing process: Big Data driven Hierarchical Digital Twin Predictive Remanufacturing (BDHDTPREMfg) is proposed. And the definition of BDHDTPREMfg is proposed. A big data driven layered architecture and the hierarchical CPS-Digital-Twin(CPSDT) reconfiguration control mechanism of BDHDTPREMfg are respectively developed. Then, this paper presents an application scenario of BDHDTPREMfg to validate the feasibility and effectiveness.

"A framework for digital twin driven product recycle, disassembly and reassembly","Remanufacturing plays an important role in promoting sustainable production. Novel models and methods have been proposed to optimize the key phases of remanufacturing, such as recycling decision-making, disassembly control, parts classification, and reassembly management. However, the implementation of product remanufacturing still faces some challenges: 1) uncertain features of recycling increasing complexity of remanufacturing, 2) difficulty of physical disassembly, 3) imprecise quality classification of returned products, and 4) exceptions existing in remanufacturing processes. As the development of advanced information technologies (e.g. internet of things) and simulation technologies, digital twin was proposed and gained wide attention. By digital twin technologies, the behaviors of physical entities can be monitored, simulated and validated in virtual space to facilitate optimizing the physical activities and making informed decisions. In this paper, a framework for digital twin driven product recycle, disassembly and reassembly was proposed to optimize product remanufacturing processes. Within the proposed framework, real-time management and optimization of remanufacturing processes can be achieved. A proof-of-concept case was used to illustrate the potential future application mode of proposed framework. © 2018, Curran Associates Inc.
