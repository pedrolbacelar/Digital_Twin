    ## Description
    The server is responsible for executing the external services of
    the Digital Twin, such as Remaining Cycle Time prediction and Decision
    Making based on RCT for branch points.

    ## RCT-based decision making
    The RCT is used as criteria for deicision making in branch points. When
    a part in the real world arrives in a Branch Point this services is reqquested.
    - Measure how many brench points exists in the simulation
    >Scenario Creation<
    - For a given part id, creates the total amount of combination possible
    of paths using the existing branch points 
    - Each combination creates a part with the right branch parameters for decision
    making
    >Measurement<
    - Each part is a simulation that will generate an RCT
    - The Server measures as well the RCT indicator that is basically comparing the
    current RCT with the highes (1 - RCTi / max(RCT) )
    - If the lowest RCT path is lower thant a certaing threshold,
    the Server will choose the combination with lowest RCT to be implemented
    - In the end, is also possible to calculate (using the real log) what would be
    the RCT of the part with and without the RCT optimization

    **Branch Point:** Is defined as point in the model where a machine can create
    different branchs, i.e, a machine with multiple output queues. In this type of point
    a machine in the physical world needs take a decision about where to put the part in 
    the most optimized path.

        This run method is one of the service related to the decision making based on the

        #### TO-DO
        - Indentify the approach selected
        ##### Approach 1
        1) Get the all the path
        2) Create a dict for each path to store the RCT for each part after the simulation is done
        3) Loop through the number os paths created
            - take the current path being analysed
            - use that path as input for the function of assigning paths to the parts
            - run the simulation
            - for each part that were in branchin DM, store the RCT for each path 
                - Maybe a matrix, each line for a part and each collunm for a simulation
                - Or in dicitonary...

        ##### Approach 2
        1) Get all the possible paths
        2) Get all the parts in Branching Points
        3) For each part in Branching Point ...
            4) For each possible path ...
                5) Assign to that part the current path
                6) Simulated
                7) Get the RCT 
                8) Stored it in a dict, where the key is the part name and the data is
                a vector where each element of the vector is the RCT for a path.
                Thus, following the same order as simulate ( ordered of path)
        9) Call a function to analyse the RCTs from the dict (RCT check)
            9.1) The function should compare the RCTs value and see if it's higher than
            a threshold

        Run RCT tracking for a specific palletID. The function should translate the palletID to
        a PID. For this specific PID, the function runs a simulation until the PID get finished
        and based on that calculates the RCT. Ideally, this function is called every time that the
        service is required (align with Synchronization). After every prediction the function saves
        the RCT in a table of the exp_database writing the PID and the RCT. So when the PID is finished
        a new PID is created for the same palletID and the calculation continues. In the end, with this function
        (since the DT is aligned and updated) it will be possible to have a more precise prediction.

        TODO:
        1) Extract the PID for a given PalletID
        2) Run a simulation for this targeted PID
        3) Calculate the Remaining Cycle Time for that target PID
        4) Write the PID and RCT in a table
        
        WARNINGS:
        1) In the physical system when the last machine finished a PID it takes a while to 
        be created a ne PID (needs to reach the first machine again)
